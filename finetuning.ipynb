She was found to be hypoglycemic to 29 with hypotension and bradycardia. Her hypotension and confusion improved with hydration. She had a positive UA which eventually grew klebsiella. She had temp 96.3, respiratory rate 22, BP 102/26, a leukocytosis to 18 and a creatinine of 6 (baseline 2). Pt has blood cultures positive for group A streptococcus. On the day of transfer her blood pressure dropped to the 60s. She was anuric throughout the day. She received 80mg IV solumedrol this morning in the setting of low BPs and rare eos in urine. On arrival to the MICU pt was awake but drowsy. On ROS, pt denies pain, lightheadedness, headache, neck pain, sore throat, recent illness or sick contacts, cough, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, heartburn, abd pain, n/v, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria.

The patient was in her usual state of health at her nursing home until yesterday morning when she sustained a fall when trying to get up to go to the bathroom. The fall was not witnessed, but the patient reportedly did not lose consciousness. The patient complained of neck and rib pain. She was taken to OSH, where she was found to have a comminuted fracture of C2. In the ED, the patient's VS were T 99.1, BP 106/42, P 101, R 24. She had an ECG which showed sinus tachycardia and ST depressions in V3 and V4. CT head was negative for ICH.\", 'An 82 man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status-post bioprosthetic atrial valve replacement for atrial stenosis, atrial fibrillation with cardioversion, right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer status-post colectomy, presents with 9 day history of productive cough, fever and dyspnea.', \"A 94 year old female with hx recent PE/DVT, atrial fibrillation, CAD presents with fever and abdominal pain. Earlier, she presented with back pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have bilateral PE's and new afib and started on coumadin. Her HCT dropped slightly, requiring blood transfusion, with guaic positive stools. She was discharged and returned with abdominal cramping and black stools. EGD showed a small gastric and duodenal ulcer (healing), esophageal stricture, no active bleeding. She also had an abdominal CT demonstrating a distended gallbladder with gallstones and biliary obstruction with several CBD stones.\", 'This is a 41-year-old male patient with medical history of alcohol abuse, cholelithiasis, hypertension, obesity who presented to his local hospital with hematemasis. On Friday evening he had several episodes of vomiting of bright and dark red material. In the emergency department, initial vs were: T 98.6 P66 BP145/89 R16 O2 sat 98% RA. He was started on a protonix gtt and octreotide gtt given his elevated liver function tests. Lab tests show elevated lipase, pancytopenia and coagulopathy. He had a right upper abdominal quadrant ultrasound which demonstrated gallstones and sludge and ascites. As such given new ascites and abdominal pain he was given levofloxacin 750mg IV and flagyl 500mg IV reportedly for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis. On the floor, he reports that he had two episodes of vomiting of dark red emesis. Per his nurse it was about 75ml and was gastrocult positive.

He did receive flu and pneumovax vaccines. He has had a recent admission last month with progressive dyspnea on exertion. The computed tomography revealed increased ground glass opacity in lower lobes superimposed on pulmonary fibrosis with elevated eosinophils peripherally (12%). A bronchoalveolar lavage was also positive for eosinophils. He was started on high dose steroids (prednisone 60mg) with plan for close outpatient follow up for eosinophilic lung disease. He was discharged on 2-3L nasal canula. He then represented to the emergency department for spontaneous pneumomediastinum of unclear etiology. On day of current admission, the patient called his pulmonologist complaining of worsening shortness of breath since Saturday. Yesterday he was at pulmonary rehab and desaturated to the 70s on 6L with minimal exertion, and he is currently on 4L nasal canula at rest. No sick contacts recently. He was asked to go to ED.
