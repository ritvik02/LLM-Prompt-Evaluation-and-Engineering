              "'The circulatory system is also called the cardiovascular system, where “cardi” refers to the heart, and “vascular” refers to the blood vessels. So, these are the two key parts: the heart, which pumps blood, and the blood vessels, which carry blood to the body and return it back to the heart again. Ultimately, this is how nutrients like O2, or oxygen, get pushed out to the organs and tissues that need it, and how waste like CO2, or carbon dioxide, which is the main byproduct of cellular respiration, gets removed.The heart is about the size of a person’s fist, which makes sense: a bigger person has a bigger fist and, therefore, a bigger heart.And it’s shaped like a cone, and sits slightly shifted over to the left side, in the mediastinum, which is the middle of the chest cavity, or thorax.It sits on top of the diaphragm, which is the main muscle that helps with breathing, behind the sternum, or breastbone, in front of the vertebral column, squished in between the two lungs, and protected by the ribs.   If you look more closely, you can see that the heart sits inside a sac of fluid that has two walls, called the serous pericardium. The outer layer is called the parietal layer. It gets stuck tightly to another layer called the fibrous pericardium, which is made of tough, dense connective tissue, which holds the heart in place and prevents it from overfilling with blood. The inner layer is called the visceral layer, and it gets stuck tightly to the heart itself, forming the epicardium, or the outer layer of the heart. The cells of the serous pericardium, both the parietal and visceral layer -- secrete a protein-rich fluid that fills the space between those layers and serves as a lubricant for the heart, allowing it to move around a bit with each heartbeat without feeling too much friction. So, moving from the outside to the inside of the heart, after the epicardium, there’s the myocardium, which is the muscular middle layer. This forms the bulk of the heart tissue because those cardiac muscle cells contract and pump blood. In addition to cardiac muscle cells, there are crisscrossing connective tissue fibers, which are made of collagen, that together form the fibrous cardiac skeleton, which helps supports the muscle tissue. The myocardium also has dedicated blood vessels - called coronary vessels - which lay on the outside of the heart and then penetrate into the myocardium to bring blood to that layer because it needs a lot of energy to pump blood. Finally, there’s the innermost layer of the heart, called the endocardium, which is made of a relatively thin layer of endothelium, which is the same layer of cells that line the blood vessels. This endocardium lines the heart chambers and heart valves.  All right, so on the right side of the heart, deoxygenated blood enters either through the top, through a blood vessel called the superior vena cava, or the bottom, through another blood vessel called the inferior vena cava, in the right atrium, where “atrium” means “entryway.”. Both vena cavas are veins, which bring blood towards the heart. There’s also a tiny third opening into the right atrium called the coronary sinus, which collects blood from coronary vessels returning from the myocardium. Now, all of that blood then goes through the first of two atrioventricular valves that separate the atria from the ventricles. This one is called the tricuspid valve, and it allows blood into the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three little flaps or ‘cusps’, and each cusp looks kind of like a parachute because it has tiny little strings called chordae tendinae coming off of it that tether the cusp to a small muscle called a papillary muscle. When the heart contracts, that papillary muscle keeps the chordae tendinae taut, and both of these help to prevent regurgitation of blood back into the atrium, allowing it to only flow out next valve.That being said, that contraction pumps the blood out the pulmonary valve which like the tricuspid valve has three cusps and also prevents blood from going backwards - but unlike the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve doesn’t have any of those chordae tendinae. Once it’s past the pulmonary valve, the blood goes into the pulmonary arteries which carry the blood away from the heart to the left and right lung. Just remember that arteries start with “a” and carry blood “away” from the heart. The blood goes from the pulmonary artery into a pulmonary arteriole, which is a bit smaller, and finally into a capillary, which is the smallest. In the lungs, the capillary lines up alongside a small sack of air called an alveolus - and when you have a lot of them they’re called alveoli. Up until now the blood has been loaded with carbon dioxide, which makes the blood look dark red rather than blue, which is how it’s usually drawn, and how we’ll still draw it to stay consistent. Now, at this point in the journey, the carbon dioxide moves from the capillary to the alveolus and oxygen moves from the alveolus to the capillary, giving the blood that nice bright red color.   Now, in the blood, each red blood cell has millions of hemoglobin proteins, and each of these hemoglobins can bind to four oxygen molecules, so each red blood cell can carry millions of oxygen molecules when fully loaded! The oxygen-rich blood moves into a venule and then eventually into a pulmonary vein that dumps the blood into the left atrium. This trip -- from the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and back to the left atrium of the heart -- is called the pulmonary circulation.  After entering the left atrium, the blood goes through the second atrioventricular valve, called the mitral valve, into the left ventricle. The mitral valve has only two cusps or leaflets, one in front called the anterior leaflet that’s a little smaller and one behind it called the posterior leaflet. Both of these have chordae tendinae coming off of them that tether the valve to papillary muscles in the left ventricle. Similar to the right side of the heart, when it contracts, this prevents blood from going backwards.   Finally, blood in the left ventricle gets pumped out through the aortic valve, which normally has three cusps, out to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. Just like in the lungs, the aorta branches into arterioles which are smaller arteries and finally into capillaries which are the smallest, and at that point they’re at the organs and tissues. In the organs, the red blood cells line up alongside tissue cells and drop off oxygen and pick up carbon dioxide, basically the reverse of what happened with the alveolus in the lung. Loaded up with carbon dioxide, the blood turns that dark red color again, shown as blue, and starts the return journey to the heart by going into small venules and then larger veins. Now, the lower half of the body drains into the inferior vena cava, and the upper half drains into the superior vena cava, both of which dump blood back into the right atrium.   So this trip -- from the left ventricle of the heart to the body and back to the right atrium of the heart -- is called the systemic circulation. Now, relative to the pulmonary circulation, the systemic has a lot more blood vessels, which means there’s about a 5 times greater resistance to blood flow, which essentially meaning it’s a lot harder to pump blood through, even though it’s the same amount of blood being pumped as the pulmonary side. Because of this difference, the left ventricle needs to be stronger, and so the muscular layer of the left ventricle wall - or its myocardium - is three times thicker than the right ventricle’s myocardium.   Okay so let’s talk a little bit about that pumping. Every heartbeat, sounds something like, “lub dub, lub dub, lub dub.” So the first heart sound - “lub”, is called S1, and the noise comes from the tricuspid and mitral valves snapping shut when the left and right ventricles contract which happens at about the same time. Right after the S1 sound, the aortic valve and pulmonic valve open up, allowing blood to get pushed out to the body, and this period of time is called systole. The second heart sound - “dub”, is called S2, and the noise comes from the aortic and pulmonic valves snapping shut to prevent blood from flowing backwards after it leaves the ventricles - effectively ending systole. Right after the S2 sound, the tricuspid and mitral valves open back up, allowing blood to fill up the ventricles again, and this period of time is called diastole. That’s it, each heartbeat can be broken into systole and diastole. So a systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the ventricles are squeezing out blood under high pressure, and diastolic blood pressure is when the ventricles are filling up with more blood, so it’s going to be slightly lower pressure.   Alright so if we simplify this guy a bit, then the amount of blood that is pumped out by either ventricle over a period of time is called the cardiac output. And the rate at which the veins return blood back to the atria is called venous return -- pretty easy to remember, right? Since the circulatory system is a closed loop, cardiac output and venous are equal.   Okay so let’s use some numbers to make this a little more concrete. Let’s say that about 70ml is ejected per squeeze, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute or 70 squeezes per minute. Then 70 x 70 is 4900ml per minute, which in liters is 4.9 L per minute. Meaning this heart’s pumping abut 4.9 L per minute.  Now, in an average adult there’s about 5 L of blood total in the body, which just to be clear is different from the cardiac output we just found, which was the amount pumped per minute. Now, taking this total volume, 10% of that (or about 0.5 ml) is in the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins which make up the pulmonic circulation, and 5% (or .25L) is in one of the four chambers of the heart itself.   Another 15% (or 750 ml) is in the systemic arteries, travelling away from the heart, 5% (or 250 ml) is in the systemic capillaries, and the remaining 65% (or 3.25 L) is in the systemic veins returning to the heart. Now, in terms of where all of that systemic arterial blood goes - about 15% goes to the brain, 5% nourishes the heart itself, 25% goes to the kidneys, another 25% goes to the gastrointestinal organs, yet another 25% goes to the skeletal muscles, and the the last 5% goes to the skin. These numbers can change, for example during exercise, but it gives you a general sense of things.   Alright so that was the systemic arterial blood, but you’ll notice that there’s a lot more blood in the systemic veins, with that being said, arteries are generally lower volume while also being under much higher pressure. In contrast, veins are high volume, low pressure vessels. This explains why arteries and veins have different structures. For example, veins often have valves to help fight gravity and keep blood flowing in one direction back to the heart, whereas arteries don’t need these valves because they’re under higher pressure.  If we take a closer look at blood vessels, they have three layers, also called “tunics,” or coverings, that surround the vessel lumen, which is the hollow part of the vessel that contains the blood. The innermost tunic is the tunica intima, which includes the endothelial cells which create a slick surface that minimizes friction for blood moving through. Next, there’s the tunica media, or middle tunic, which is mostly made of smooth muscle cells and of sheets of elastin protein. Both the cells of the tunica intima and tunica media generally get the nutrients they need from the blood in the lumen. Finally, there’s the tunica externa, or outside tunic, which is made up of loosely woven fibers of collagen protein that protect and reinforce the blood vessel and anchor it in place. The tunica externa also has nerve fibers, lymphatic vessels, and, in the biggest vessels, the protein elastin. To make things really wild, some huge vessels have a tunica externa that is so thick that it needs its own blood supply! So there are tiny blood vessels, called the vasa vasorum, which means “vessels of the vessels,” that creep along the tunica externa to bring nutrients to that layer of the blood vessel wall.  So largest arteries closest to the heart, which are the aorta, its main branches, and the pulmonary arteries -- have so much elastin in their tunica externa and media that they’re called the elastic arteries. These guys are really stretchy -- kinda like spandex -- and this is what allows these arteries to keep their shape as well as absorb and even out the systolic and diastolic pressures. These arteries eventually branch into the arterioles, the smallest of the arteries. In the arterioles, the tunica media is bulky, and can contract in response to hormones and the autonomic nervous system, which is called vasoconstriction, where the lumen gets a lot smaller, which decreases the blood to a capillary bed and ultimately organ or tissue. Also these vessels can relax, or vasodilate and the lumen’s diameter increases, which allows more blood flow. This process can also help with temperature control, or thermoregulation, because blood carries a lot of heat and when it gets near the surface of the skin, more of that heat is lost. So with vasodilation of arterioles, more heat’s lost, which therefore helps to lower body temperature, likewise if you wanted to raise body temperature, vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, which means less heat gets lost through the surface of the skin.  Finally, the capillary walls are generally only one cell thick - just the tunica intima layer, with some larger vessels that also have a subendothelium basement membrane layer, which is a layer of protein just outside of the endothelial cells that provides extra support. In addition to allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to flow back and forth, capillaries are also where nutrients like glucose can get delivered, and where fluid can move out of the blood vessel and into the interstitial space - which is the space between the blood vessels and cells. Water-soluble substances, like ions, cross the capillary wall either through water-filled spaces, called clefts, between the endothelial cells, or through large pores in the walls of fenestrated capillaries. Meanwhile, lipid-, or fat-soluble, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can dissolve and then diffuse across the endothelial cell membranes.   On the other end of the capillary bed, there’s a venule, and the arteriole and venule are usually directly connected by a vessel called the metarteriole.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, the pulmonary circulation goes from the right ventricle which delivers blood to the lungs, which then sends fresh oxygenated blood to the left atrium, at which point it enters the systemic circulation starting with the left ventricle which pumps blood to the body, and then deoxygenated blood comes back to the right atrium and it starts all over again!

All right, so on the right side of the heart, deoxygenated blood enters either through the top, through a blood vessel called the superior vena cava, or the bottom, through another blood vessel called the inferior vena cava, in the right atrium, where “atrium” means “entryway.”. Both vena cavas are veins, which bring blood towards the heart. There’s also a tiny third opening into the right atrium called the coronary sinus, which collects blood from coronary vessels returning from the myocardium. Now, all of that blood then goes through the first of two atrioventricular valves that separate the atria from the ventricles. This one is called the tricuspid valve, and it allows blood into the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three little flaps or ‘cusps’, and each cusp looks kind of like a parachute because it has tiny little strings called chordae tendinae coming off of it that tether the cusp to a small muscle called a papillary muscle. When the heart contracts, that papillary muscle keeps the chordae tendinae taut, and both of these help to prevent regurgitation of blood back into the atrium, allowing it to only flow out next valve.That being said, that contraction pumps the blood out the pulmonary valve which like the tricuspid valve has three cusps and also prevents blood from going backwards - but unlike the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve doesn’t have any of those chordae tendinae. Once it’s past the pulmonary valve, the blood goes into the pulmonary arteries which carry the blood away from the heart to the left and right lung. Just remember that arteries start with “a” and carry blood “away” from the heart. The blood goes from the pulmonary artery into a pulmonary arteriole, which is a bit smaller, and finally into a capillary, which is the smallest. In the lungs, the capillary lines up alongside a small sack of air called an alveolus - and when you have a lot of them they’re called alveoli. Up until now the blood has been loaded with carbon dioxide, which makes the blood look dark red rather than blue, which is how it’s usually drawn, and how we’ll still draw it to stay consistent. Now, at this point in the journey, the carbon dioxide moves from the capillary to the alveolus and oxygen moves from the alveolus to the capillary, giving the blood that nice bright red color.   Now, in the blood, each red blood cell has millions of hemoglobin proteins, and each of these hemoglobins can bind to four oxygen molecules, so each red blood cell can carry millions of oxygen molecules when fully loaded! The oxygen-rich blood moves into a venule and then eventually into a pulmonary vein that dumps the blood into the left atrium. This trip -- from the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and back to the left atrium of the heart -- is called the pulmonary circulation.  After entering the left atrium, the blood goes through the second atrioventricular valve, called the mitral valve, into the left ventricle. The mitral valve has only two cusps or leaflets, one in front called the anterior leaflet that’s a little smaller and one behind it called the posterior leaflet. Both of these have chordae tendinae coming off of them that tether the valve to papillary muscles in the left ventricle. Similar to the right side of the heart, when it contracts, this prevents blood from going backwards.   Finally, blood in the left ventricle gets pumped out through the aortic valve, which normally has three cusps, out to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. Just like in the lungs, the aorta branches into arterioles which are smaller arteries and finally into capillaries which are the smallest, and at that point they’re at the organs and tissues. In the organs, the red blood cells line up alongside tissue cells and drop off oxygen and pick up carbon dioxide, basically the reverse of what happened with the alveolus in the lung. Loaded up with carbon dioxide, the blood turns that dark red color again, shown as blue, and starts the return journey to the heart by going into small venules and then larger veins. Now, the lower half of the body drains into the inferior vena cava, and the upper half drains into the superior vena cava, both of which dump blood back into the right atrium.   So this trip -- from the left ventricle of the heart to the body and back to the right atrium of the heart -- is called the systemic circulation. Now, relative to the pulmonary circulation, the systemic has a lot more blood vessels, which means there’s about a 5 times greater resistance to blood flow, which essentially meaning it’s a lot harder to pump blood through, even though it’s the same amount of blood being pumped as the pulmonary side. Because of this difference, the left ventricle needs to be stronger, and so the muscular layer of the left ventricle wall - or its myocardium - is three times thicker than the right ventricle’s myocardium.   Okay so let’s talk a little bit about that pumping. Every heartbeat, sounds something like, “lub dub, lub dub, lub dub.” So the first heart sound - “lub”, is called S1, and the noise comes from the tricuspid and mitral valves snapping shut when the left and right ventricles contract which happens at about the same time. Right after the S1 sound, the aortic valve and pulmonic valve open up, allowing blood to get pushed out to the body, and this period of time is called systole. The second heart sound - “dub”, is called S2, and the noise comes from the aortic and pulmonic valves snapping shut to prevent blood from flowing backwards after it leaves the ventricles - effectively ending systole. Right after the S2 sound, the tricuspid and mitral valves open back up, allowing blood to fill up the ventricles again, and this period of time is called diastole. That’s it, each heartbeat can be broken into systole and diastole. So a systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the ventricles are squeezing out blood under high pressure, and diastolic blood pressure is when the ventricles are filling up with more blood, so it’s going to be slightly lower pressure.   Alright so if we simplify this guy a bit, then the amount of blood that is pumped out by either ventricle over a period of time is called the cardiac output. And the rate at which the veins return blood back to the atria is called venous return -- pretty easy to remember, right? Since the circulatory system is a closed loop, cardiac output and venous are equal.   Okay so let’s use some numbers to make this a little more concrete. Let’s say that about 70ml is ejected per squeeze, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute or 70 squeezes per minute. Then 70 x 70 is 4900ml per minute, which in liters is 4.9 L per minute. Meaning this heart’s pumping abut 4.9 L per minute.  Now, in an average adult there’s about 5 L of blood total in the body, which just to be clear is different from the cardiac output we just found, which was the amount pumped per minute. Now, taking this total volume, 10% of that (or about 0.5 ml) is in the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins which make up the pulmonic circulation, and 5% (or .25L) is in one of the four chambers of the heart itself.   Another 15% (or 750 ml) is in the systemic arteries, travelling away from the heart, 5% (or 250 ml) is in the systemic capillaries, and the remaining 65% (or 3.25 L) is in the systemic veins returning to the heart. Now, in terms of where all of that systemic arterial blood goes - about 15% goes to the brain, 5% nourishes the heart itself, 25% goes to the kidneys, another 25% goes to the gastrointestinal organs, yet another 25% goes to the skeletal muscles, and the the last 5% goes to the skin. These numbers can change, for example during exercise, but it gives you a general sense of things.   Alright so that was the systemic arterial blood, but you’ll notice that there’s a lot more blood in the systemic veins, with that being said, arteries are generally lower volume while also being under much higher pressure. In contrast, veins are high volume, low pressure vessels. This explains why arteries and veins have different structures. For example, veins often have valves to help fight gravity and keep blood flowing in one direction back to the heart, whereas arteries don’t need these valves because they’re under higher pressure.  If we take a closer look at blood vessels, they have three layers, also called “tunics,” or coverings, that surround the vessel lumen, which is the hollow part of the vessel that contains the blood. The innermost tunic is the tunica intima, which includes the endothelial cells which create a slick surface that minimizes friction for blood moving through. Next, there’s the tunica media, or middle tunic, which is mostly made of smooth muscle cells and of sheets of elastin protein. Both the cells of the tunica intima and tunica media generally get the nutrients they need from the blood in the lumen. Finally, there’s the tunica externa, or outside tunic, which is made up of loosely woven fibers of collagen protein that protect and reinforce the blood vessel and anchor it in place. The tunica externa also has nerve fibers, lymphatic vessels, and, in the biggest vessels, the protein elastin. To make things really wild, some huge vessels have a tunica externa that is so thick that it needs its own blood supply! So there are tiny blood vessels, called the vasa vasorum, which means “vessels of the vessels,” that creep along the tunica externa to bring nutrients to that layer of the blood vessel wall.  So largest arteries closest to the heart, which are the aorta, its main branches, and the pulmonary arteries -- have so much elastin in their tunica externa and media that they’re called the elastic arteries. These guys are really stretchy -- kinda like spandex -- and this is what allows these arteries to keep their shape as well as absorb and even out the systolic and diastolic pressures. These arteries eventually branch into the arterioles, the smallest of the arteries. In the arterioles, the tunica media is bulky, and can contract in response to hormones and the autonomic nervous system, which is called vasoconstriction, where the lumen gets a lot smaller, which decreases the blood to a capillary bed and ultimately organ or tissue. Also these vessels can relax, or vasodilate and the lumen’s diameter increases, which allows more blood flow. This process can also help with temperature control, or thermoregulation, because blood carries a lot of heat and when it gets near the surface of the skin, more of that heat is lost. So with vasodilation of arterioles, more heat’s lost, which therefore helps to lower body temperature, likewise if you wanted to raise body temperature, vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, which means less heat gets lost through the surface of the skin.  Finally, the capillary walls are generally only one cell thick - just the tunica intima layer, with some larger vessels that also have a subendothelium basement membrane layer, which is a layer of protein just outside of the endothelial cells that provides extra support. In addition to allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to flow back and forth, capillaries are also where nutrients like glucose can get delivered, and where fluid can move out of the blood vessel and into the interstitial space - which is the space between the blood vessels and cells. Water-soluble substances, like ions, cross the capillary wall either through water-filled spaces, called clefts, between the endothelial cells, or through large pores in the walls of fenestrated capillaries. Meanwhile, lipid-, or fat-soluble, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can dissolve and then diffuse across the endothelial cell membranes.   On the other end of the capillary bed, there’s a venule, and the arteriole and venule are usually directly connected by a vessel called the metarteriole.\n",
            "“Lymph” means “clear water” in Latin, and it describes the fluid that flows through the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes which make up the lymphatic system. The three major roles of the lymphatic system - the reason we need it in the first place - are that it returns fluid from the tissues back to the heart, it helps large molecules like hormones and lipids enter the blood, and it helps with immune surveillance to keep infections from running amok.So, let’s take a closer look at lymph and where it comes from. The blood in the arteries is under a lot of pressure because it needs to reach every little nook and cranny of the body. The arteries branch out into narrower and narrower arteries, and then arterioles, and finally gets to the capillaries - which have walls that are only one cell thick and are slightly porous. Red blood cells are too big to fit through capillary pores, but small proteins like albumin and fluid can make it through. Every day 20 liters of fluid water and protein - seep out of the capillaries and becomes part of the interstitial fluid between cells. About 17 liters gets quickly reabsorbed right back into the capillaries,but that leaves 3 liters of fluid behind in the tissues each day. This 3 liters of fluid needs to find a way back into the blood so that the body’s interstitial fluid volume and blood volume both stay constant over time. That’s where the lymphatic vessels, or lymphatics, come in: they collect excess interstitial fluid and return it to the blood. Once the interstitial fluid is in the lymphatic vessels, it’s called lymph. Now - you may be wondering how there can be 20 liters of fluid seeping out each day if the blood volume is only 5 liters, but remember that the 5 liters is constantly in motion and that it gets recycled over and over in a single day. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system isn’t a closed loop because fluid and proteins make their way into the microscopic lymphatic capillaries, and all of the collected lymph is dumped into the veins. Lymphatic capillaries are the smallest lymphatic vessels, and they’re located throughout the interstitial space. Lymphatic capillaries are extremely permeable because their walls are made of endothelial cells that only loosely overlap, forming one-way minivalves. These endothelial cells are anchored to structures in the interstitial space by collagen filaments, which allows the lymphatic capillaries to remain flexible but retain their overall shape. When the pressure in the interstitial space is greater than the pressure in the lymphatic capillary, the endothelial minivalves open up, allowing fluid to enter. When the pressure in the interstitial space is less than the pressure in the lymphatic capillary, the endothelial minivalves are pushed shut, keeping the lymph inside. Once the lymph is inside the lymphatic capillaries, it travels through bigger and thicker-walled vessels, then trunks, and then ducts. There’s no pump pushing the lymph through the lymphatic system; instead, smooth muscle in the lymph vessels reacts to the pulsing of nearby arteries by squeezing to get things started, and then the squeezing of skeletal muscles, which normally contract throughout the day, exert external pressure to keep the lymph moving along eventually reaching a nearby lymphatic trunk. To keep the lymph from sliding backwards, the lymphatic vessels have valves just like the veins. The lymphatic trunks are named after the regions of the body that they drain the lymph from: two lumbar trunks, two bronchomediastinal trunks, two subclavian trunks, and two jugular trunks, as well as one intestinal trunk. From there, the lymph is delivered to either the right lymphatic duct which collects lymph from the right arm and the right side of the head and chest, or the thoracic duct, which is much bigger and collects lymph from the rest of the body. The right lymphatic duct dumps lymph into the junction of the right jugular vein and the right subclavian vein, and the thoracic duct dumps lymph into the same junction on the left side of the body. That particular spot is perfect because it’s where the pressure is very low, making it much easier for the lymph to flow in. The lymphatic system has key advantages: for example it can pick up larger molecules, like hormones, that are too large to get into the capillaries, and get them into the bloodstream. The lymphatic system can also help get nutrients to the tissues. For example, during a meal, fatty acids get packaged into balls of fat called chylomicrons by the small intestine. But like the hormones, these are too large to move across capillaries. Instead, the chylomicrons go into special lymphatic vessels called lacteals, which get their name from the fact that the lymph that flows through them looks like milk. The chylomicrons slowly make their way up into the thoracic duct and get dumped into the venous blood. The lymphatic system also plays an important role in immune function. Lymphoid organs remove foreign material from the lymph to keep it from entering the bloodstream, and act as lookout points for the body’s immune defenses. Some lymphoid organs are in the form of diffuse lymphoid tissue, where they are just a loose arrangement of lymphoid cells and protein, this is typical in the lining of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. Another type of lymphoid organ are lymph nodes, which are tightly packed balls of lymphoid cells and protein. Hundreds of lymph nodes cluster along the lymph vessels, each one a few millimeters to about 1–2 cm in size. When they’re concentrated along the lymph trunks, you can feel them, especially in the neck, armpit, and groin. They can also be found in the intestinal wall, where they’re called Peyer’s patches. When an infection gets into the tissue, it can slip into a lymphatic capillary and move into a lymphatic vessel. Unfiltered lymph fluid drains into a nearby lymph node where any pathogen or piece of pathogen is quickly detected by a dendritic cell - a type of antigen-presenting cell that serves up pieces of anything in destroys to other immune cells. In the lymph nodes, dendritic cells continuously sample the lymph and present antigens that they come across to the B cells which are a type of lymphocyte that can make antibodies. B cells are designed to only react to foreign antigens, and if the dendritic cell presents something foreign, the B cell turns into a plasma cells and starting cranking out antibodies which flow into the lymph exiting the lymph node. There are also circulating T cells, which are another type of lymphocyte that move between the lymph nodes, lymph, and blood on the lookout for pathogens and infected or abnormal cells that have been tagged by antibodies.Another lymphoid organ is the spleen, which is about the size of a fist, and sits on the left side of the body below the diaphragm and on top of the stomach. The spleen has both white pulp and red pulp. The white pulp is where antibody-coated bacteria are filtered out of circulation and antibodies are generated by B cells. In a sense, the white pulp of the spleen is like a giant lymph node, although unlike a lymph node which receives unfiltered lymphatic fluid, the spleen receives blood. The red pulp of the spleen is where old and defective blood cells are destroyed and their parts - the hemoglobin, the heme chain, and the iron - are either broken down or recycled. The spleen is also a helpful in that it keeps a red blood cells and platelets available in case they are suddenly needed by the body. An organ that’s got your back in an emergency.Another lymphoid organ is the thymus, which is in the upper part of the chest - just below where a necklace might lie. The thymus is most active in the neonatal period and pre-adolescent years, and then slowly atrophies and gets replaced by fat after puberty. The thymus is involved in the development of T cells - making sure that any T cells that react to self-antigens, antigens that are normally found in the body, are promptly destroyed. A final set of lymphoid organs worth mentioning are the tonsils, which include the adenoid, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils. Together they form a ring of lymphoid tissue around the throat, and their main job is to trap pathogens from the food you eat and air you inhale.\n",
            "Pressure is a force over an area, so with blood pressure, we’re measuring the force that the blood exerts on the surface area of the walls of the blood vessels. Differences in blood pressure throughout the body keep blood flowing from high-pressure areas, like the arteries, to low-pressure areas, like the veins. When we say “blood flow,” we’re referring to the volume of blood that flows through a vessel or an organ over some period of time. Now, the amount of blood flow from one end of a blood vessel to another is affected by the blood pressure, and by the resistance, which comes from the vessels themselves. Vasoconstriction, where the vessels constrict, decreases blood flow, and vasodilation, where the blood vessels expand, increases blood flow.   Now, blood flow is not the same thing as the velocity of blood. Blood flow is the volume of blood that moves by a point over some period of time. So let’s say this chunk of blood has a volume of 83 cm^3, and it took 1 second for this much to flow past the blue circle—this is the blood flow, represented by the variable capital Q.   Now, velocity on the other hand, is the distance traveled in a certain amount of time. So maybe in the same one second, a red blood cell at the very edge here traveled a distance of 27 cm, then it’d be moving 27 cm/s, represented by lowercase v. Even though these aren’t equal, they are related, and the last piece is area, specifically the cross-sectional area of the blood vessel, which in reality is the same as the blood cross section like this. So, based on units, since area’s going to be expressed in cm^2, we see that flow rate equals area times velocity! Alright, so for example, let’s say we want to calculate blood velocity, and we have a person’s cardiac output of 5L/min, which is average for an adult, and the diameter of their aorta, which is 2cm.  First off, using the equation for the area of a circle, (D/2)^2 x pi, we get (2 / 2)^2 x pi = 3.14 cm^2. Next, since cardiac output is the same as blood flow, we just need to convert this L/min to cubic cm per second, so there are 1000 cubic cm in a L, and 60 seconds in a minute, so multiplying those out we get 83 cubic cm per second. Then, rearranging our little formula, velocity equals flow rate divided by area, and we get about 26 cm per second! Which is also about 1 km / hr!  Going back to blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance, that relationship can be written out mathematically as well. So, to start, you have an initial, higher pressure at one end, and a final, lower pressure at the other. The difference between these, or the initial minus the final pressure, sometimes expressed as delta P, equals blood flow through that vessel multiplied by resistance. This can be also written as Q equals change in pressure over resistance. So, for example, let’s say the the blood vessel narrows, which increases the resistance, in order to keep the flow of blood to organs the same, the pressure difference has to increase, and this is typically what happens. This equation might look familiar to a similar equation, where change in voltage V equals current I times resistance R, also known as ohm’s law!   Okay, let’s talk about pressure. Blood pressure is usually highest in a large artery like the brachial artery, which is where blood pressure is usually measured, That’s because at that point the blood still needs to be able to push through the smaller arterioles and capillaries, which means lots of resistance. In an average adult, blood pressure is about 120/80 mmHg or millimeters of mercury. That might look like a fraction, but it’s not. The first number, 120, is the systolic pressure, which is the force that the blood exerts on the walls of the arteries during systole, when the heart contracts to pump blood through the body, and the second number, 80, is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure on the walls of the arteries during diastole, when the heart relaxes and refills with blood between heartbeats. That’s why the first number is bigger: the arteries are under more pressure when there’s more force from the heart pushing the blood.  The mean arterial pressure, or MAP, is the average pressure on the arteries during a complete cardiac cycle, including the systolic and diastolic pressures. It can be calculated a couple ways. The first is the quickest: we assume that about ⅓ of the cardiac cycle is spent in systole and about ⅔ of the cardiac cycle is spent in diastole and say that the MAP = ⅓ (systolic blood pressure) + ⅔ (diastolic blood pressure). Another measuremnt is the pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure, so in our example, it would be 120 - 80 or 40 mm Hg. So another way to figure it out is to say that MAP = ⅓ (pulse pressure) + diastolic pressure, which is exactly the same thing, but just written differently.   Now, a completely different way to think about MAP is by using the relationship between blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance. Let’s go back to our big artery, say this time it’s the aorta, the biggest of the arteries coming right from the heart itself. That artery goes to arterioles and capillaries, representing the whole human body, and then the venous blood returns to the right atrium of the heart. So in this zoomed out view, the initial pressure here is pressure in the arteries, in other words—the mean arterial pressure, and the final pressure over here is we have the central venous pressure, or CVP, in the vena cavae right before they enter the right atrium.   Looking back at our equation, Pi - Pf = Q x R, blood flow is the total blood flow through all of the blood vessels and organs, which is called the cardiac output and is measured in L/min. Pi is MAP and Pf is CVP, and finally, the combined resistance of all of the blood vessels of systemic circulation would be the systemic vascular resistance, called SVR,. So the equation is MAP - CVP = CO x SVR. CVP is usually a small number, so it’s usually ignored and the equation is simplified to MAP = CO x SVR. Based on this relationship, you can see why for example, an increase in resistance, which is mostly caused by arteriole vasoconstriction, will cause the blood pressure to rise.\n",
            "When we talk about pressures in the cardiovascular system, we’re talking about blood pressure. Pressures in different parts of the cardiovascular system aren’t equal and these differences in pressures keep the blood moving from high pressure areas leaving the heart like the arteries to low pressure areas like the veins. Actually, the pressure curve looks a little more like this, and fluctuates in the arteries depending on part of the cardiac cycle it’s in, with these peaks being systole, and these low points being diastole -That being said, this original line is the average of these fluctuations, or the mean arterial pressure. Now, since systole takes up about a third of a single cardiac cycle, and diastole takes up the remaining 2/3 of the cycle, we can calculate the mean arterial pressure at any time by the equation:                                MAP = (⅓) SBP + (⅔) DBPWhich after distributing we get:                                MAP = DBP + (⅓) PPNow, looking at these fluctuations on the arterial side, there’s a couple important things to notice. First of all, on the downswing of the curve, there’s a sharp sharp pressure drop followed by a rise again forming what’s called the dicrotic notch or incisura. As blood is ejected out into the aorta, pressure rises quickly, and then as a tiny amount of blood flows back into the ventricle, and causes the valve to snap shut and the pressure to fall. That snapping shut of the valve causes it to recoil back, which causes a brief increase in pressure of aorta, and then finally the pressure falls as the aorta settles and the heart relaxes.A second interesting thing to notice is that the pulse pressure in the large arteries downstream of the aorta is larger than those in the aorta themselves!That’s because the pressure from blood travels a bit faster than blood itself. To understand that idea - think of the molecules and cells in the blood like Newton’s cradle, and while they move together, they bump into each other and transmit that pressure wave faster than the group can move as a whole, meaning that the pressure wave actually increases the pressure downstream. Also, the pressure waves bounce off the branch points in the arteries, which causes them to reflect back and increase the pressure in the arteries even more.Alright, so it should seem a little weird that both systolic pressure and pulse pressure are higher in the downstream arteries, since we know that blood wants to move from a high pressure area to a low pressure area, but one thing to remember is that in the large arteries the diastolic pressure is lower, and remember that it’s the mean arterial pressure that drives blood flow, which this is mostly affected by diastolic pressure, which is highest in the aorta. As an example, let’s say the aorta’s SBP is 115 and DBP is 85, meaning PP is 30. That said, the MAP is 95 mmHg. Now, if the large arteries’ SBP is 120 and DBP is 80, with a PP of 40, the MAP ends up being 93, which is lower than in the aorta like we’d expect! Okay, so as we move out from the arterial tree, the pressure gets lower and lower as the arteries branch out into smaller and smaller arteries and then arterioles and then capillaries. As the blood move across the arterioles the pressure falls from about 80 mmHg to 30 mmHg. As the vessels branch into smaller and smaller arterioles, resistance goes up, and since resistance goes up, and according to the equation flow rate equals change in pressure or pressure initial minus pressure final, divided by resistance, with increased resistance, the pressure final or downstream pressure must decreases, which increases the change in pressure and keeps flow rate constant. Across the capillaries, the pressure drops from 30 mmHg down to about 10 mmHg. So the pressure drop is greater across the arterioles then the capillaries, even though capillaries are even smaller, which means even more resistance. The pressure drop is less, though, because there are so many capillaries that run in parallel to one another, that it helps to reduce total resistance, since total resistance for vessels in parallel is less than the resistance in any individual vessel. After the capillaries, blood goes into the venules and then the larger veins. At this point, the pressure drops aren’t great because the blood vessels have a larger and larger radius and have a high compliance and can expand to hold more blood.Finally blood makes it to the vena cavae, and pressure is roughly 4 mmHg and right atrial pressure is around 2 mmHg. Even though there are only small differences in pressure, it’s enough to move blood back to the heart, even when it’s going against gravity. Various clinical situations can cause pressures in the system to go up or down, and that affects all of the downstream pressures as well. As an example, let’s take a closer look at the normal aortic pressure curve, and then two situations that often alter aortic pressures. The first is arteriosclerosis, which is a chronic condition where the arteries become stiff and less compliant, a bit like a rubber hose turning into a lead pipe over time. The baseline diastolic pressure usually doesn’t change, but the extra volume of blood that exerts pressure on the walls during systole, results in enormous increases in systolic pressure because the walls are so stiff. The high systolic pressure with the unchanged diastolic pressure means that there is also an increased pulse pressure and therefore an increased mean arterial pressure. The second example is aortic stenosis - a narrowing of the aortic valve which increases it’s resistance. With increased resistance, the change in pressure must increase, which means there’s a decrease in pressure after the valve. The diastolic pressure remains unchanged, but there’s a decrease systolic pressure, decreased pulse pressure, and decreased mean arterial pressure. Alright, so this whole bit we just talked about is the systemic circulation, but once the blood gets the right atrium it enters the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation. So here in the pulmonary arteries, the pressure is 25 mm Hg during systole and 8 mm Hg during diastole, which means that the mean arterial pressure in the pulmonary artery is 25 (⅓) + 8 (⅔) = 14 mm Hg. That pressure drops to 10 mm Hg in the capillaries, to 8 mm Hg in the pulmonary vein, then to 2-5 mm Hg in the left atrium.\n",
            "Laminar means smooth, and so laminar blood flow is blood that’s flowing smoothly through the vessels. Turbulent flow, on the other hand, is when the blood’s not flowing smoothly, and we can figure out if blood is likely to be laminar or turbulent by finding its Reynolds number or Re, which is named after Osborne Reynolds, a Victorian scientist who not only studied fluid dynamics, but is a man that knows how to rock a beard and bowtie.If everything’s moving like it should and the blood flow is laminar, the linear velocity of the blood  -- how fast it’s moving in a straight line -- is greatest in the center of the blood vessel, and lowest near the walls of the vessel, dropping to zero at the wall. Sometimes, though, blood flow is disrupted, like if it has to pass by a crusty old atherosclerotic plaque along the wall, which reduces the diameter of the blood vessel at that point and causes turbulence. There are a number of factors help predict turbulence, they include the density of the blood, usually denoted by the greek letter rho, the viscosity denoted by the greek letter nu. You can kind of think of a fluid’s viscosity as it’s thickness, like for example the viscosity of honey is greater than that of water. Alright, then there’s velocity of blood flow (v), and the diameter of the blood vessel (d)These values can all be used to come up with a single value—the reynold’s number, often denoted Re, and the equation looks like this: NR = pdv/Generally speaking, if the Reynolds number is low - below 2000, then blood flow will be laminar - think “low” and “laminar”, and if the Reynolds number is above 3000 it’ll be turbulent. A Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 is somewhere in between. As a real-life example, a person with anemia has a low red blood cell count, and in general has a lower hematocrit, the ratio of red blood cells to total blood volume. This essentially means the blood’s less thick or viscous, which means based on our equation, if viscosity decreases, reynolds number increases. Also, these individuals often have an increased cardiac output, which means increased blood velocity and therefore increased reynolds number.Another example would be a person with a thrombus, or blood clot, which just like the atherosclerotic plaque would narrow or decrease the diameter of the blood vessel...now, at first glance this seems a little weird eh? But it turns out that blood velocity also depends on the diameter of the vessel, by the equation velocity equals flow rate over area, which after subbing for the area of the blood vessel, is 4Q over pi d^2, so plugging that in for velocity, we see that as diameter decreases, reynolds number increases!Now a related concept is shear. Now, remember how the velocity of the blood depended on whether it was in the center or near the walls? Where it’s fastest in the middle and really slow near the walls, in fact at the molecular level, just outside the walls, water molecules are just sort of loitering around not moving! If we freeze it and plot these velocities, we’ll notice that this difference in velocity is parabolic, meaning that as you move away from the walls, velocity at first jumps up pretty quick, but as you near the middle, the change in velocity is pretty low. This difference in relative velocities is the shear! So if we wanted to plot shear, near the wall where velocity’s changing the most, shear’s actually the highest, and in the middle shear is very low and actually drops to zero.Shear goes hand-in-hand with viscosity, because the higher the shear, the lower the viscosity of the blood. This is because shear helps to pull the elements in the blood apart decreasing it's stickiness, or viscosity, making blood less viscous at the vessel walls and more viscous in the middle of the vessel.Now, let’s say all the blood’s somehow moving at the same velocity. Well in that case, if you plot it out, there’s no change in velocity across the blood vessel, and that makes plotting shear pretty easy...since there’s no change in velocity there’s no shear, and likewise this fluid isn’t viscous!\n",
            "Blood flow refers to the volume of blood travelling through a blood vessel, an organ, or the entire body over a period of time, and it can be measured as liters per minute. As blood flows, it encounters various factors that resist flow and movement of blood, known as the vascular resistance.The first factor to contribute to vascular resistance is blood viscosity, where you can think of viscosity as the fluid’s thickness, or how sticky it is. The relationship is directly proportional, which can be represented as resistance ∝ η which is the greek letter eta and represents viscosity. So this means that as viscosity goes up, it’s harder it is for the liquid’s molecules to slide past each other, and the resistance goes up. Think about a heaping stack o’ pancakes, then picture some maple syrup. Even on flipping the syrup upside down it doesn’t really come out right away and resists moving right away; slowly it gloops out and doesn’t splash but just coats those pancakes in a delicious film of sugary goodness, oh right. Now, with another stack, grab some orange juice and pour...it immediately comes out and pretty goes everywhere. This is because the the juice is less viscous than the syrup, so there’s going to be less resistance to movement. Because blood is full of large proteins and cells, it’s pretty viscous and moves much more slowly than just plain water, or orange juice. Blood viscosity doesn’t change much over time, but certain conditions like polycythemia, where the person has too many red blood cells, can increase viscosity, and conditions like anemia, where the person doesn’t have enough red blood cells, can decrease viscosity.A second factor that affects resistance is total blood vessel length. Just like with viscosity, the relationship is directly proportional, and this can be represented as resistance ∝ L, so, simply put, shorter vessels have less resistance and longer vessels have more resistance because there’s more friction resisting flow. This means that as a child grows into an adult, their blood vessels will get longer, and their peripheral resistance will go up.A third factor that affects resistance is blood vessel radius, which in this case is inversely proportional to resistance...to the fourth power! Meaning that that as a vessel’s radius goes down, its resistance really goes up. Unlike viscosity and length, the radius can change from minute to minute, especially the radius of arterioles, which can vasoconstrict like when you’re lying at home on the couch, which would decrease diameter and increase resistance, or vasodilate like when you’re running outside playing frisbee, which would increase diameter and decrease resistance.Now, the equation relating all these variables is resistance R is equal to 8 times viscosity eta times length L divided by pi times radius r to the fourth power.Now keep in mind that resistance is also related to blood pressure and blood flow by the relationship: Q = . So let’s apply this to a real-life situation, let’s say a person has a blood flow of 300 ml/min going through their carotid artery and they suddenly develop a blockage of exactly half of the artery, which can happen in a stroke, what would happen to the blood flow? Well, a 50% blockage means that the radius is now ½ of what it was, and looking at our equation, since nothing else has changed, plugging in 1/2r for our original r, we get ½ r to the fourth or 1/16 r, meaning resistance goes up by 16 times! iAssuming that the blood pressure doesn’t change right away, subbing in this new 16 times greater resistance, we see that the blood flow drops by 16 times,i from 300 ml/min to 300 ml/min / 16 = 19 ml/min, which is a huge drop!So that’s how resistance works for a single vessel. Now, what if you have a bunch of different sized vessels in a row, each with their own resistance, and you wanted to figure out the total resistance? Well since, they’re in a row one after another, we say they’re in series, and you simply add the individual resistances all together to get a total resistance. That’s called the serial resistance. As an example, let’s think about blood heading out to a cell in your toe and back. After leaving your heart, It has to go through an artery, then through an arteriole, then through a capillary alongside that toe cell, then back through a venule, and finally through a vein to reach the heart. If we add up all of those individual resistances, our total will equal the total resistance faced by the blood flow going to the toe cell and then back to the heart, assuming there are no branches in the system and no other cells to worry about. When we arrange resistance in series like this, the blood flow through each part of the system is the same, but the resistance at each level will differ mostly based on the length and radius of each vessel. So far, so good. Of course, this doesn’t account for the millions of branch points in the circulatory system, and for that we have to think about the concept of parallel resistance. In short, it’s when two vessels branch and move blood in parallel and then meet up again, which is exactly what happens in the circulatory system since there is a lot of branching and ultimately all of the blood meets up again in the right atrium. To calculate the total resistance for these portions where the vessels split, we use1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + etc.So to apply these two equations, let’s say that we want to figure out the total resistance here. In this case we have five different resistances to worry about. Now let’s give these some numbers, Let’s say we’ve got a larger but longer blood vessel with a resistance of 6, and then it branches into three. The very thin blood vessel in the middle has a resistance of 10, and the slightly larger ones on either side both have a resistance of 5. Then all the branches come back together and connect to a short wide vessel with a resistance of 2. Now, these resistances do have units, but for simplicity’s sake I’m not showing them, but in case you’re curious resistance is measured as mmHg・minutes/Liter. To figure out the total resistance we need to break this down into two parts, and we’re going to add up the parallel resistance of the three vessels in the middle first. So that’s ⅕ + 1/10 + ⅕, which is 2/10 + 1/10 + 2/10, which is 5/10, which remember is equal to 1 over R total. So if we flip 1/Rtotal and 5 over 10, we get Rtotal equals 10 over 5 which equals 2. So this is the resistance of this chunk of parallel vessels. That makes sense, because with parallel resistance, the total is always less than the resistance of any one component. Now that we have the combined resistance of the parallel guys, the remaining are just in series, so we just add up 6 + 2 + 2, and that’s 10 or 10 mmHg・minutes/Liter, which just happens to be right around the actual resistance you see in the entire systemic circulation, by comparison, the pulmonary circulation has only 1/10th of that resistance, it’s closer to 1 mmHg・minutes/Liter.It’s also worth mentioning quick that, just like before, the flow through these bits in series is the same, along with the total flow through this whole parallel system. The flow through each of these parallel vessels though, is not the same, since the blood has to split flow through each of the vessels, although, the sum of these three flows must equal the total flow!\n",
            "Compliance, which is sometimes called capacitance or distensibility, refers to the ability of a vessel to respond to an increase in pressure by to distending or swell and increase the volume of blood it can hold, or with decreased pressure, a decrease in volume. The way that this applies to blood vessels is to remember that they are stretchable tubes like rubber hoses rather than lead pipes. So if the pressure increases, the walls of the tube can actually stretch out a bit to accommodate a larger volume, and exactly how much they stretch out depends on their compliance.We can calculate a given blood vessel’s compliance, C, by dividing the volume of blood, V, in mL by the amount of pressure (P) in mmHg, that the blood is experiencing. And so we measure compliance in mL / mm Hg.So we can plot out volume as a function of pressure, where the slope, volume over pressure, is the compliance. The veins have high compliance, meaning they’re high-volume, low pressure vessels, and even a small increase in pressure expands the volume a loti. The arteries, on the other hand have low compliance, and are low-volume, high pressure vessels, meaning with same amount of pressure, their volume doesn’t expand as much. Furthermore, a hardened artery would be even less compliant, and is like a lead pipe, in other words it takes an incredible amount of pressure to change the volume even a tiny bit.With that in mind, since veins are more compliant, the majority of the blood in the body at any given time is in the veins, whereas less blood is in the thicker, less compliant arteries at any given time. Now, when the arteries harden due to arteriosclerosis, they become even less compliant over time, which means they can’t hold as much blood volume at the same pressure. That volume of blood is going to wind up in the veins. In this situation, blood simply moves away from the even higher pressure arteries to the area of lowest pressure, typically where the compliance is highest, like the veins. Now, if compliance, or volume over pressure, is it’s tendency to stretch out with pressure, than its inverse would be it’s tendency to not stretch, or another way to think about it is its tendency to recoil back to its original shape, which is a concept known as its elastance E. Both of these concepts are super relevant for large elastic arteries like the aorta, which literally comes right off the heart. Now, first off, heart cells take ATP and use that chemical energy to contract during systole, turning it into mechanical energy. This propels blood out into the aorta. Since it’s moving blood, it has kinetic energy, but also since it’s exerting pressure on the walls of the vessel, it also has pressure energy, a form of potential energy, and the sum of these two is equal to the total energy E, which we’ll represent by this little health bar thing, which is filled with kinetic energy in blue and pressure energy in purple. So, let’s just say that during this time that pressure energy corresponds to a pressure of 140 mmHg. After the heart contracts, it relaxes and is filling with blood, called diastole. Now, during this time the blood’s still moving and there’s still pressure, but it’s just much less energy. So the pressure energy drops significantly, let’s say to something that corresponds to 50 mmHg. The difference between these, in this case 90 mmHg, is called the pulse pressure.Okay, but in reality even though the aorta isn’t very compliant, during systole it still stretches out with these high-pressure contractions, some of that volume is held in this distended space, since it’s very elastic, the walls store some of that energy of contraction as elastic energy in the walls, another form of potential energy. Since the total energy has to stay the same, there’s less pressure and kinetic energy to make way for that elastic energy. so less pressure energy means the blood pressure isn’t as high, let’s say 120 mmHg. Now, during diastole, the elastic walls recoil or snap back, moving that blood that was held during systole out into the circulatory system and that stored elastic energy gets converted back to pressure energy and kinetic energy, so now pressure energy gets added, yielding a pressure of say 60 mmHg, which means the new pulse pressure is lower—60 mmHg.So, with elastic arteries, the blood pressures are 120 over 60, with a difference or pulse pressure of 60 mmHg, and remember without the elastic properties, it was 140 / 50 with a pulse pressure of 90. So here we see these large elastic arteries buffer or dampen the pulse pressure, and this whole phenomenon is known as the Windkessel effect!As a person ages, healthy compliant arteries become stiff and non-compliant, resulting in blood vessels that behave more like the non-elastic case, which means pulse pressure ultimately goes up.\n",
            "The main job of the heart is to pump oxygenated blood with nutrients through the arteries to the body’s tissues and receive back deoxygenated blood full of waste products through the veins. Now, let’s zoom into the left ventricle. There’s a moment when the left ventricle is fully relaxed. It occurs at the end of filling or diastole, also called the end-diastolic point, and the volume of blood within the left ventricle is called the end-diastolic volume, and it’s about 120 milliliters. Then the left ventricle contracts, forcing blood through the aorta and into the whole arterial system. After that is another moment when the left ventricle is fully contracted. It occurs at the end of contraction or systole, also called the end-systolic point, and the volume of blood within the left ventricle is called end-systolic volume, and it’s about 50 milliliters. So, end-diastolic volume minus end-systolic volume, gives us the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood that the left ventricle ejects with every heartbeat, or stroke. In this case, the stroke volume is 120 minus 50, which equals 70 milliliters. Stroke volume is a useful measurement, but it can vary based on the size of a person. For example, a stroke volume of 50 milliliters might be absolutely fine for a small person with a small heart volume, but may be low for a large person with a bigger heart volume. So another helpful measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume, Ejection fraction = Stroke Volume / End- Diastolic Volume. In a normal individual that’s 70/120, or about 58%, but it can fluctuate between 50 and 65% and still be considered normal. In other words, at least half of the blood volume in the left ventricle should get pumped out during each heartbeat. In hearts that have a low contractility - a low force of contraction - the ejection fraction can fall below 50%.  Every minute, though, our heart beats many times, so if we multiply the stroke volume times the heart rate, or the times our heart beats per minute, we’ll get the cardiac output, which is the total volume of blood the left ventricle ejects in one minute. Using the stroke volume of 70 ml/ beat and a resting heart rate of 70 beats/minute, cardiac output is 4900 ml/min, or 4.9 liters/min. Remember that a normal adult body contains approximately 5 liters of blood, so this means that every last drop of blood travels through the left ventricle at least once every minute! Of course, the heart can adjust it’s heart rate and the stroke volume based on whether you’re sleeping or doing exercise. In fact, trained athletes can have a cardiac output that reaches up to 35 liters/ minute! The cardiac output flows through the arteries and is distributed to the various organs meet their oxygen and nutrient demands. Of all of the organs, the liver receives the largest amount of blood flow. The kidneys also get a lot of blood flow, but less than the liver. However, when correcting for the mass of these tissues, the kidney gets much more blood per gram of tissue than any other organ - and this is called tissue perfusion. So flow refers to the total amount of blood volume going someplace like an organ over time, and perfusion refers to the total amount of blood volume going to a gram of tissue over time.\n",
            "More than a century ago, two physiologists, Otto Frank and Ernest Starling discovered that as the heart gets filled up with more blood during diastole, it contracts harder and pumps out more blood during systole. So they came up with the Frank Starling Law to explain this relationship. To understand this relationship, let’s zoom into the wall of the ventricles. The bulk of these walls is made up of short, branched cardiac muscle cells packed one next to the other. Zooming in further, if we look inside the muscle cells, we see bundles of myofibrils, or long chains of sarcomeres. The sarcomere is the smallest structure in the muscle that is capable of contracting so it's considered the basic contractile unit of the muscle. The sarcomere has two Z discs that form its boundary and a M line in the middle.  Attached to the Z disc are thin filaments made of actin protein. These actin filaments have structural polarity which means both ends of the filament look different.  We can think of it like an arrow with the pointed end being the “minus end,” pointing towards the M line, and the tail end being the “plus end,” attached to the Z disc. Just like an arrow, the actin filament can only move in one direction: the direction it’s pointed at.  Attached to the M line are the myosin filaments which are thick bundles of myosin proteins with two globular heads. During a muscle contraction, the myosin heads grabs onto the actin filaments, and pull them towards the M line which brings the two Z discs closer together.  Overall, the amount of tension developed, or the force of muscle contraction during systole, depends on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin. And this number directly depends on the length of the overlapping section between actin and myosin filaments. The length of the overlapping section depends on the overall length of the sarcomere. And the length of the sarcomere depends on how much blood fills the ventricle during diastole - because that affects how stretched out the overall muscle wall and each sarcomere within it end up being. This relationship is known as the cardiac length-tension relationship and it can be shown by this  graph, with the sarcomere length or the ventricular end- diastolic volume on the x axis and the tension or pressure developed within the ventricle, during their contraction, or systole, on the y axis.So let’s imagine that the ventricles are mostly empty, with almost no blood in them.  This would mean that there’s nothing stretching the muscles in the ventricular wall, so the length of sarcomeres are really short. At this length, the two Z discs are pulled close to each and there’s not much room for further contraction. Furthermore, the actin filaments from each side of the sarcomere crosses the M line and overlap. Since actin can be pulled only in one direction- towards the midline, myosin has to attach and pull the actin filament with the right structural polarity: the one pointing in the same direction as that the myosin pulls. So, when the actin filaments overlap, myosin is prevented from binding to its own actin filament by the actin filament from the other side with the wrong polarity. As a result, very few myosin- actin attachments are made and the cells can contract only very weakly during systole. On the graph, we can see near the point of origin, the short length of myocardial fibers corresponds with a low contractile force. As the ventricles fill with more blood returning through the veins, their walls get more and more stretched and that stretches out every single sarcomere in the muscle cells as well. This means that there’s more space, and no actin overlapping which allows more myosin heads to properly interact with actin and as a result, create more force, or tension, during contraction. Looking at the graph, this would make our curve move steadily upwards with increasing force as there’s increasing volume. This stretching can go on until it exceeds a maximal point, after which things start getting too stretched out. This means the Z discs are so far apart from each other that there’s only little overlap between actin and myosin filaments and actin gets out of reach from myosin. As a result, there's a decreased number of myosin heads that manage to attach to actin and pull it towards the M line.  This leads to a decreased force of contraction, so the curve starts falling off again. Now, that we’ve seen the relationship between length of the sarcomeres and tension during contraction in systole, let’s look at the Frank Starling relationship. This can be also be plotted onto a similar graph, with the ventricular end- diastolic volume on the x axis and the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood pumped out by the ventricle with each heartbeat, on the y axis. So, at the start of the curve, near the bottom left- hand corner, we have a low end diastolic volume meaning very little blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. So sarcomeres are squeezed together with very few myosin heads binding to actin. This results in a weak contraction during systole and a low stroke volume. As the volume of blood returning to the ventricles increases, sarcomeres stretch, and there’s more myosin-actin binding, so a greater strength of the contraction is achieved and stroke volume rises. That’s true until the end- diastolic volume becomes so high, and the myosin and actin get too far apart, the number of myosin and actin binding decreases, resulting in a weaker contraction, so the stroke volume falls off again.Keep in mind though that this curve reflects the heart’s intrinsic ability to vary the strength of contraction based on the volume of blood that it’s filled with.  Within the body, though, there are plenty of extrinsic signals as well like nerve or hormonal stimuli and medications. Some of these signals, like stimulation from the sympathetic nervous system or the medication digoxin, can have a positive inotropic effect on the heart. This means that at a given end- diastolic volume, they increase the strength of contraction, moving the curve upwards and increasing the stroke volume. On the other hand, there are negative inotropic agents, like medications like beta- blockers, that decrease the strength of contraction, moving the curve downwards and decreasing stroke volume.\n",
            "Pressure- volume loops are graphs, where the pressure inside the left ventricle is on the y axis and the volume of the left ventricle is on the x axis. Each loop represents one cardiac cycle, including both ventricular systole and diastole, or more simply, one heartbeat. Alright, let’s start at the lower right hand corner. This is the end-diastolic point, and it’s the point in the cardiac cycle when diastole is over. The mitral valve, or the “communicating door” between the left atrium and left ventricle has just closed. And as it closed, it made a loud, long sound, kind of like a “lup”. That’s known as the first heart sound, or S1. So, at this point, the left ventricle is filled with the maximum volume of blood, known as end- diastolic volume, which is normally about 120 milliliters. You can imagine the ventricle as a relaxed sack of muscle that’s full of blood, so pressure is low. After that, the left ventricle contracts, and that marks the beginning of systole. This makes the pressure shoot up, but since both mitral and aortic valves are closed, blood can neither enter nor leave the ventricle, the volume doesn’t change. This phase is called isovolumetric contraction and it lasts for about 0.05 seconds. Eventually the pressure inside the left ventricle reaches approximately 75 mmHg, becoming just higher than the pressure inside the aorta, forcing the aortic valve to pop open. This pressure reflects the pressure in the aorta right at the beginning of ejection phase, or the lowest that the blood pressure in the aorta is going to be and is known as the diastolic blood pressure, or DBP for short. Okay, now, once the ejection phase starts, it lasts for about 0.25 seconds. That’s when blood is ejected out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, decreasing left ventricular volume. The left ventricle continues to contract, so ventricular pressure keeps rises further. Meanwhile, blood is rushing through the aorta, so its pressure increases, as well. In fact, during this phase, left ventricular and aortic  pressures are essentially equal. This goes on, until they reach a peak of about 120 mmHg, known as systolic blood pressure, or SBP for short, before finally starting to come down again. The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures, in this case 120 - 75 equals 45 mmHg and is called pulse pressure, because it reflects the throbbing pulsation felt in an artery during systole. Eventually, aortic pressure exceeds the pressure within the left ventricle, so the aortic valve snaps shut, making a short, sharp sound, kind of like a “dub”. And this dub is called the second heart sound, or S2. So, this marks the end of the systolic period, also known as end-systolic point. At this point, the volume left inside the left ventricle, known as end- systolic volume, is normally about 50 milliliters. If we calculate the difference between end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, we’ll get the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood the left ventricle ejects or simply, squeezes away, on every heartbeat, or stroke, during this ejection period. In this case, 120 minus 50 is a stroke volume of 70 milliliters. Stroke volume is a useful measurement, but it can vary based on the size of a person’s heart. So another helpful measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume, Ejection fraction = Stroke Volume / End- Diastolic Volume. In this example, it’s 70/120, or about 58%. In other words, 58% of the blood volume in the left ventricle gets pumped out during each heartbeat.  Once the aortic valve has closed, the ventricular muscle starts relaxing, so pressure within the ventricle falls. However, all valves are closed, so the volume remains constant. This is the isovolumetric relaxation phase, and it lasts for about 0.15 seconds. Eventually, the pressure drops below left atrial pressure, and that allows the mitral valve to open. Due to the pressure gradient, blood from the left atrium flows into the ventricle, at the beginning passively, and at the very end, with an extra push, due to the atrial contraction. As the left ventricle fills with blood, its volume comes back up to 120 ml, or its end- diastolic value, while its pressure increases only slightly. Actually, this relaxation phase goes on for kind of a long time period, compared to the previous phases, about 0.55 sec, until there’s no more pressure gradient between the two heart chambers and mitral valve closes, letting the cycle start all over again.All this happens during one heartbeat. With every heartbeat, or stroke, the heart is doing work. And that’s called “stroke work” and it’s proportional to the area inside the loop. In other words, the bigger the loop and the more the area inside of it, the more stroke work our heart does.\n",
            "Pressure- volume loops are graphs, where the pressure inside the left ventricle is on the y axis and the volume of the left ventricle is on the x axis. Each loop represents one cardiac cycle, including both ventricular systole and diastole, or more simply, one heartbeat.The lower right hand corner is the end-diastolic point, and it’s the point in the cardiac cycle when diastole is over. Αt this point, the mitral valve is closed and the left ventricle is filled with the maximum volume of blood, known as end-diastolic volume. After that, the left ventricle contracts, and systole begins. This makes the pressure shoot up, but since both mitral and aortic valves are closed, the left ventricular volume doesn’t change. This phase is isovolumetric contraction. Eventually the pressure inside the left ventricle exceeds aortic pressure, forcing the aortic valve to pop open, and that starts the ejection phase. Blood leaves the left ventricle and goes into the aorta, decreasing left ventricular volume. The left ventricle continues to contract, so ventricular pressure keeps rises further, but then falls slightly and finally the aortic valve shuts when aortic pressure exceeds the left ventricular pressure. That point, called the end-systolic point, marks the end of systole. At this point, left ventricular pressure is called end-systolic pressure, and left ventricular volume is called end-systolic volume. The difference between end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, is the stroke volume. After that, the left ventricular muscle starts relaxing, so left ventricular pressure falls. However, all valves are closed, so the volume remains constant. This phase is isovolumetric relaxation. Eventually, the pressure drops below left atrial pressure, and that allows the mitral valve to open and blood to flow from the left atrium flows into the left ventricle. As the left ventricle fills with blood, its volume rises back to its end-diastolic volume, and the pressure increases only slightly. This relaxation phase continues until the mitral valve closes, letting the loop start all over again. All this happens during one heartbeat. With every heartbeat, or stroke, the heart is doing work. And that’s called “stroke work” and it’s proportional to the area inside the loop. In other words, the bigger the loop and the more the area inside of it, the more stroke work our heart does.Sometimes, you’ll see this simplified to look more like a box. The vertical dimension of the box is the distance from the x-axis to end-systolic pressure, and the horizontal dimension is the stroke volume. And we can draw it over the pressure volume loop - so that it looks like this. In terms of stroke work, it would be the area inside the box. The box isn’t exactly the same as the loop, but it’s a good approximation. Okay, now that we’ve seen what the normal pressure-volume loop looks like, let’s see how it varies if we change some parameters. First, let’s say we increase the preload by adding more blood to the left ventricle during diastole. That means that during diastole, this bottom line goes further, and that increases the end-diastolic volume. Because of the Frank-Starling relationship, there’s a strong contraction. The isovolumic contraction phase doesn’t look any different, but once blood gets ejected, it’s clear that there’s going to be a larger than normal stroke volume. The end-systolic pressure and volume end up being about the same as what they were before. So an increased preload leads to a larger pressure-volume loop, and that means there’s increased stroke work. Now, let’s say we increase afterload by increasing the blood pressure in the entire arterial system, including in the aorta itself. That means that during isovolumic contraction, the ventricular pressure has to rise higher-than-usual before it exceeds aortic pressure and makes the aortic valve open. During the ejection phase, relatively high-pressured blood leaves until aortic pressure exceeds left ventricular pressure. Since there’s elevated blood pressure, the end-systolic pressure ends up being high as well, and that means that there’s a relatively small stroke volume, and that more blood is left within the left ventricle. In this situation, there’s a trade-off, a smaller stroke volume, with a higher pressure - which means that the stroke work remains relatively stable. Finally, let’s say that we increase contractility, by giving a medication to the heart that makes it contract more forcefully. That means that during the ejection phase, blood is under higher pressure, and therefore, the ejection phase goes on for much longer, eventually ending when the left ventricular pressure equates the aortic pressure at the same end-systolic pressure, but now that point occurs with a much smaller left ventricular volume. In this situation, there’s a big increase in stroke work, because there’s a larger stroke volume and even though the end-systolic pressure is unchanged, the blood is under higher pressure, so it increases the size of the pressure-volume loop. #SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, pressure- volume loops can be used to visualize the effects of changing preload, afterload, and contractility. An increase in preload and contractility, increases the size of the pressure-volume loop and therefore increases the stroke work. An increase in afterload, increases the pressure, but decreases the stroke volume, and that means that the stroke work remains relatively stable.\n",
            "Action potentials are the really rapid electrical changes that occur across the membrane of certain cells, and often propagates from one cell to an adjacent cell. Cells in the heart communicate this way. That signal’s gotta start somewhere, so some of these cells, called pacemaker cells, have the responsibility of  setting the rhythm and the pace of the heartbeat. They’ve got this really important job, but they’re a relatively tiny group -- only about 1% of the heart cells -- and they’re able to continually generate new action potentials that get conducted to the rest of the heart -- the other 99% -- and that’s what tells the heart pump. Now, pacemaker cells also listen to which usually come from neighboring pacemaker cells. But if those don’t come, then a pacemaker cell will simply launch its own and that action potential will then spread around. This is called automaticity, and that’s easy to remember because it’s got “automatic” right in it. So let’s start by mapping out those pacemaker cells. The first clump of pacemaker cells is tucked up here into the corner of the right atria, and that’s the sinoatrial node, which sometimes gets called the SA node. We’ve also got pacemaker cells in internodal tracts between nodes, in the atrioventricular, or AV node, the Bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers, and that’s our electrical conduction system.And all around these pacemaker cells are heart muscle cells or cardiomyocytes and they pick up the action potential too, but that happens just a tiny bit more slowly -- we can think of these bands of pacemaker cells as highways that carry the action potential to its destination super fast, and then the muscle cells are like little side roads where it’s slower. That’s important because we want all of the myocytes to pick up that action potential and contract at the same time. We call this whole system a functional syncytium, which means that the mechanical, chemical, and electrical connections between these cells allow them to act as one unit in some ways, and it’s the pacemaker cells that make that happen.Okay, now let’s take a closer look at the chemistry that gets that action potential moving. Action potentials are initiated by depolarization, which is the opposite of polarization. Polarization is when there’s a higher negative charge inside the cell relative to outside the cell, and that difference in charge is called the membrane potential. So if the membrane potential is negative the inside of the cell is more negative than the outside, if it’s positive the inside is more positive than the outside, and if it’s 0mV, then the inside and outside have the same charge - there’s 0mV of difference. Ok -- so, the key here is understanding how the membrane potential changes, and it all comes down to the movement of ions. Specifically, two factors -- which ion wants to move across the membrane, and how permeable the membrane is to that ion. So, depolarization is when ions move across the membrane and the membrane potential becomes less negative or even slightly positive. Think of a really pessimistic negative cell throwing his hands up and enjoying a moment of joy. When one cell depolarizes enough - it can cause some ions to flow into neighboring cells and trigger them to depolarize as well. If one cell after another depolarizes, then there’s a depolarization wave which you can imagine would look like a wave moving through a crowd at a football stadium. Each depolarization wave causes heart muscle contraction, so the rate at which depolarization waves ripple through the heart actually sets the heart rate. So if depolarization waves are going through about once per second, that means that your heart beats once per second, or sixty times in a minute. Now let’s focus on a single pacemaker cell going through a single action potential. The action potential of both pacemaker cells and myocytes are broken into five phases, often shown on a graph of membrane potential vs. time. We’re going to start at Phase 4, because why not.Phase 4 is the pacemaker potential phase, and it starts when the pacemaker cell is just sort of hanging out with an overall charge or membrane potential of -65mV. Pacemaker cells have ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, or HCN channels on their surface. That’s a lot to take in, but basically these little HCN channels are like gates that open when the membrane potential gets really negative, like -65mV, and they specifically let in just positively charged sodium ions. An electric current is a flow of electric charge, so when these sodium ions rush into the cell, it’s a type of current that scientists have named the funny current, which is a super weird name. There’s nothing funny about it, it should be called the salty current. So as the sodium flows in through the HCN channels, in other words, as the cell becomes more permeable to sodium, the membrane potential starts to depolarize slowly, or drift upwards all the way to about -50mV. After phase 4 is phase 0, this phase is also known as the depolarization phase, even though the cell was slowly depolarizing in phase 4. Once the cell’s membrane potential reaches about -50mV, voltage-gated calcium channels start to open up, allowing calcium to flow into the cell. With sodium and calcium flowing into the cell, the membrane potential rises all the way up past 0mV and into positive territory - peaking out at about +10mV. This happens super-fast, lasting only about 0.5 milliseconds. The calcium channels remain open until it hits about the +10mV mark, at which point they start to close.Once the cell hits +10mV, we’re in Phase 3. That’s because pacemaker cells don’t have a Phase 1 or Phase 2  -- they just go right from depolarizing to repolarizing again. At this point the potassium channels open up and the calcium channels close up, so the only ion channels that remains open are the potassium channels which allow potassium to leave the cell, and the HCN channels which allow sodium to enter the cell. Because there are so many potassium ion channels relative to HCN channels, there’s a net outward positive current, meaning that positively charged ions are leaving the cell faster than they’re coming in. So, the membrane potential goes down again, all the way back to about -65 mV, which means that one full heartbeat has taken place, and then the whole process starts over with phase 4 again.\n",
            "Cardiac excitability refers to the amount of inward current needed by myocytes or myocardial cells, cells in the muscular middle layer of the heart, to depolarize or generate an action potential. Whether or not it depolarizes depends on if its voltage-gated «sodium ion channels are excitable or not. A more excitable cell might have more of its Na+ ion channels in the ready state, and even if there were a relatively weak current of Na+ ions flowing in, the cell might still depolarize easily. On the other hand, a less excitable cell might have most of it’s Na+ ion channels inactivated, where they won’t open in response to stimuli, represented by this little ball stuck in the opening, and only a few of them are ready, and it would require a strong current of Na+ ions to flow in before it depolarized. So let’s say this is a myocyte in one of the ventricles,, And this is a graph of membrane potential over time. First, a few positive ions like sodium and calcium travel through gap junctions and enter into the cell, raising the membrane potential to a threshold level—typically around 70 mV. At that point, the voltage gated Na+ channels open up, and lots of Na+ ions rush into the cell, causing depolarization. Right after depolarizing, at about +20 mV, the channels become inactivated, making those channels unavailable for another depolarization. After the upstroke, there’s the plateau, and then as the cell repolarizes the sodium channels start to recover, and even though they’re closed, they’re still excitable, and eventually the cell repolarizes back to it’s usual state around -90mV..During most of the action potential, the myocardial cell is unable to depolarize again, and this is called the absolute refractory period. In other words, during the absolute refractory period, pretty much all the myocyte’s sodium channels are inactivated, so , so even if a bunch of inward current comes from the neighboring cell, it literally can’t depolarize.There are many Na+ channels on each myocardial cell, and each Na+ channel operates independently, but overall, most of them remain inactivated after the upstroke, through, the plateau, and until the cell has repolarized to about −50 mV, at which point some channels start to recover, at which point the cell would respond to a stimulus.. Now the way that the absolute refractory period is measured is that an electrophysiologist delivers a current to a myocardial cell and in response it has an action potential. While that action potential is happening, the electrophysiologist delivers multiple bursts of current to the cell at regular intervals. If a burst of current causes nothing to happen, then that means the cell is still in the absolute refractory period. But if a burst of current causes the cell to depolarize, then that means that the cell has emerged from the absolute refractory period. Since the bursts of current are given at intervals, we landed just outside the absolute refractory period, it’s possible that the burst of current was given at the exact moment that the cell was emerging from it’s absolute refractory period. But it’s more likely that the cell emerged from the absolute refractory period at some point and then waited a tiny bit before the next burst of current was applied. In some cases the burst of current that’s used isn’t very strong, and as a result the cell may not depolarize even though it’s no longer in the absolute refractory period. So when electrophysiologists are measuring the absolute refractory period, what they end up identifying is called the effective refractory period. Next comes the relative refractory period, which begins at the end of the absolute refractory period and keeps going until the cell membrane has almost completely repolarized. During this period, some of the Na+ channels have recovered and are available for another depolarization, and the proportion of Na+ channels increases over time. A cell in the relative refractory period can depolarize, but it needs a bigger stimulus than normal. Finally, we’ve got the supranormal period, where supra- means “more than,” and this is when the myocardial cell is more excitable than usual. The supranormal period starts when the membrane potential is −70 mV, and it keeps going until the membrane is fully repolarized back to −85 mV. At this point, the Na+ channels have completely recovered, and the inactivation gates are open again. But, the cell’s membrane potential is closer to the threshold than it is at rest, so it’s slightly easier for the cell to depolarize.\n",
            "Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is the relationship between electrical signals in the form of action potentials, and mechanical changes in the heart muscle cells, called cardiomyocytes, that causes them to contract. Let’s start by looking at the structure of a cardiomyocyte. Cardiomyocytes have branches, and have intercalated disks along their edges which have small holes called gap junctions that allow ions to flow from one cardiomyocyte to the next. When a cardiomyocyte depolarizes, ions like calcium move from that cell into a neighboring cell, and these ions trigger depolarization to happen in that cell. This is what makes cardiomyocytes part of a “functional syncytium,” they’re like a little community of cells intimately working together. In addition, cardiomyocytes stay physically attached to one another through proteins called desmosomes, which are like staples that hold the cells together when they’re contracting. Another feature of cardiomyocytes are passageways called transverse tubules, or T-tubules. T-tubules are extensions of the outside environment. They increase the surface area of the cardiomyocyte and they look like the letter T, so it’s easy to remember their name. Think of a large walk-through aquarium: you can walk through tunnels and look at the sea creatures all around you, but you’re not in the water with them. Finally, there’s the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is an organelle that stores intracellular calcium, the calcium that is sequestered inside the cell. When a depolarization wavefront hits a cardiomyocyte, a few calcium ions flow through gap junctions, and if a threshold membrane potential is reached, then sodium channels start to open up. If there’s a depolarization, then ions start to move across the cell membrane, and that’s where the T-tubules play a key role. During the part of the cardiomyocyte action potential when calcium ions flow into the cell, the presence of T-tubules helps bring calcium deep into the cell. Once this extracellular calcium gets inside, it binds to the ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which releases even more calcium into the cell - a process called calcium-induced calcium release. The calcium helps activate two contractile proteins, actin and myosin, which are called myofilaments, and are ultimately responsible for cell contraction, and that’s the key moment when the chemical signal is converted into a mechanical signal. When calcium ions enter the cardiomyocyte, they bind to troponin C, which is attached to a long thin protein called tropomyosin. Tropomyosin is draped around yet another protein filament called actin, and it covers up binding sites on the actin, so that it cannot be bound by myosin heads which are lurking nearby. A bit like a protective parent not wanting a child to go out on a date. The calcium ions bind to Troponin C and that causes tropomyosin to slide off of the actin filament, exposing the actin binding sites. At that point, myosin heads bind to actin forming a cross-bridge - when the parent’s away, the children will play. The myosin head pushes past the actin with a “power stroke”, effectively pulling the actin and myosin filaments past one another and shortening the muscle. The myosin does this a few times with actin - binding, sliding past, reattaching, and then repeating this process and using up ATP along the way. The myosin head looks a bit like an oar in a boat, it hits the water, shifts, and comes out, and this only works in the presence of calcium ions. Eventually, calcium ions are removed by ion transporters, that rely on ATP or concentration gradients. Most of the calcium gets moved back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum or the extracellular environment, and some also moves into the mitochondria. Once that calcium is gone, the troponin goes back to its original shape, which blocks the binding sites on the actin and prevents more cross-bridges from forming.\n",
            "An electrocardiogram is also known as an ECG; the Dutch and German version of the word, elektrokardiogram, is shortened to EKG. It is a tool used to visualize, or “gram,” the electricity, or “electro,” that flows through the heart, or “cardio.” Specifically, a 12-lead ECG tracing shows how the depolarization wave, which is a wave of positive charge, moves during each heartbeat, by providing the perspectives of different sets of electrodes. This particular set of electrodes is called lead II; one electrode is placed on the right arm and the other on the left leg. Essentially, when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection. This big, positive deflection corresponds to the wave moving down the septum. To understand the basics, let’s start with an example of how we can look at the heart with only one pair of electrodes: a positive and a negative one. These electrodes detect the charge on the outside of the cell. Remember, at rest, cells are negatively charged relative to the slightly positive outside environment; let’s make these cells red. When they depolarize, the cells become positively charged, and leave a slightly negative charge in the outside environment; let’s make these cells green. Now, if we freeze this “wave of depolarization” as it’s moving through the cells, half of the cells are negative, or depolarized, and half are positive and resting; therefore, there’s a difference of charge across this set of cells. You can think of the charge difference as being a dipole, because there are two electrical poles. We can draw this dipole out as an arrow, or vector, pointing towards the positive charge. Remember, the electrodes detect charge on the outside of the cell, so this points toward where the positive charge is, outside. Now, if there’s a dipole vector pointing toward the positive electrode, then the ECG tracing shows it as a positive deflection; the bigger the dipole is, the bigger the deflection is. If we unpause this, then everything becomes depolarized. Since there’s no difference in charge, there’s no dipole, and thus no deflection. Moments later, a wave of repolarization goes through, and the cells become negative once again. Pausing halfway through again, now the vector dipole goes in the opposite direction, and faces the negative electrode; this means that there will be a negative ECG tracing. Again, the bigger the dipole is, the bigger the negative deflection is. Even though it’d be nice if the depolarization wave lined up perfectly with the electrodes, usually that’s not the case. So, we simply look at the vector component that is parallel to that electrode. For example, let’s say that the depolarization happened this way, at an angle; then, we’d simply break the vector into two parts. The one we care about is the one that’s going towards the positive electrode, which causes a deflection, even though it’s a slightly smaller deflection than previously. In other words, the size of the deflection on the ECG tracing always corresponds to the magnitude, or size, of the dipole in the direction of the electrode. The perpendicular component isn’t pointing at the electrodes, so it doesn’t cause any deflection. In fact, if there’s a depolarization wave that goes straight up, perpendicular to the positive and negative electrodes, there would be no deflection! In a standard ECG, there are 10 electrodes: four limb electrodes, with one each on the left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg; and six precordial electrodes, V1 through V6, that wrap around the chest. The right leg electrode is usually used as a neutral lead. The heart is a three-dimensional organ, so V1 through V6 line up in the transverse, or horizontal, plane of the heart. Each electrode is set up to detect any wave of positive charge coming towards it. These are collectively called the chest leads. Meanwhile, in the coronal plane, the non-neutral leads are called augmented vector right, or aVR, on the right arm, and augmented vector left, or aVL, on the left arm. Both of these leads are represented as vectors that are 30 degrees up from the horizontal line. Augmented vector foot, or aVF, is on the left foot, which anatomically isn’t straight down, but it’s close enough that it ends up representing the vector facing straight down on the diagram. Just like the precordial electrodes, aVR, aVL, and aVF detect any positive deflection coming towards them. Now, in addition to these three limb leads, there are also bipolar limb leads called lead 1, 2, and 3, which are recorded using two electrodes instead of just one. Lead 1 uses the RA as the negative pole and LA as the positive pole, forming a vector that goes to the right. Lead 2 uses aVR as the negative pole and aVF as the positive pole, forming a vector that goes to the +60 degree mark. Finally, lead 3 uses aVL as the negative pole and aVF as the positive pole, forming a vector that goes to the +120 degree mark. So, in total you’ve got six leads from the limb leads and six from the chest leads, which add up to 12 leads total; in other words, you have a 12-lead ecg.Having different views of the heart is important, because they make it possible for you to see how the wave of depolarization moves through the heart according to each viewpoint. For example, consider how the six chest leads, V1 through V6, register the depolarization wave form called the QRS complex. The very same depolarization wave might appear mostly negative in V1 and V2, isoelectric in V3, and mostly positive in V4, V5, and V6, because the exact direction and magnitude of the vectors are at different points in time. Similarly, each of the frontal plane leads produces its own perspective of the depolarization wave.The limb leads and chest leads can be grouped based on the regions of the heart that they are nearest. Problems in specific leads, or groups of leads, suggests that there may be a specific region of the heart affected by a disease. Leads II, III, and aVF are “inferior” leads because they’re near the inferior wall of the heart, which receives blood from the right coronary artery. Leads I and aVL, along with two of the chest leads, V5 and V6, are considered “lateral” leads because they’re near the lateral wall of the heart, which receives blood from the left circumflex artery. Finally, V1 and V2 are considered “septal” leads because they’re nearest to the interventricular septum, and V3 and V4 are “anterior” leads because they’re nearest the anterior wall of the heart. Both of the septal and anterior regions are served by the left anterior descending artery.\n",
            "An electrocardiogram - an ECG - or the dutch and german version of the word - elektrokardiogram or EKG, is a tool used to visualize “gram” the electricity “electro” that flows through the heart “cardio”. An ECG tracing specifically shows how the depolarization wave moves during each heartbeat - which is a wave of positive charge - looks from the perspective of different sets of electrodes. This particular set of electrodes is called lead II, with one electrode on the right arm and the other on the left leg, so essentially when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection, like this big positive deflection correspond to the wave moving down the septum. To read an ECG it’s really helpful to first understand what a normal sinus rhythm looks like.To do that, let’s look at a single heartbeat on an ECG - from the viewpoint of lead II. In a healthy heart, everything starts at the sinoatrial node, or SA node, - which is a little patch of tissue in the wall of the right atrium full of pacemaker cells. When one of these pacemaker cells depolarizes, a wave of positive charge spreads outward and overall it moves from the SA node towards the apex of the heart, so it aligns pretty nicely with the lead II vector.  Now, the heart muscle cells, are often described as having a functional syncytium because even though each one cell has its own cell membrane - the cells also have tiny connections or openings between them. That means that during a depolarization wave, ions can flow right from one cell to the next. Now - it’s also important to mention that the depolarization wave moves at two different speeds through the heart. In the pacemaker cells, which are special types of cardiomycocytes laid out like highways through the heart, it moves really fast, but it moves more slowly through the rest of myocytes which do the contracting - the depolarization wave moves through those like a car moving through congested small streets. The ECG measures out changes in time on the X-axis, where one small box is 0.04 s, and voltage on the Y-axis, with each small box being 0.1 mV, sometimes called 1mm voltage on the Y-axis, with each small box being 0.1mV sometimes called 1mm, with zero being called the “isoelectric line”. Every time there’s a positive or negative deflection away from this line - the isoelectric line. So a depolarization wave starts in the SA node, then goes through atrial intranodal tracts, also called Bachmann's bundle, over to the left atrium so that both atria basically depolarize together. The overall direction of that depolarization wave is in the same direction as the lead II vector, so there is a positive deflection called the P wave.  Meanwhile, the signal also gets carried from the SA node to the AV node where it gets delayed for a bit, and this allows the atria to fully contract filling the ventricles with blood. During this delay, there is no depolarization wave moving towards or away from lead II, so this shows up as a flat line and the interval from the beginning of the P wave through this flat portion is called the PR interval. From there the signal goes through the pacemaker cells that make up the Bundle of His and into the left bundle branch and right bundle branches. In addition to moving through the fast pacemaker cells, the signal also goes through the slow myocytes in the interventricular septum, in a direction that’s slightly away from the lead II vector since there is a lot of this tissue and, and creating a tiny negative deflection on the ECG - a Q wave. From there the depolarization wave flows down into the purkinje fibers. Since the largest vectors are the ones in the left ventricle, this is in the direction of lead II - this creates a large positive deflection on the ECG - an R wave. The apex of the heart depolarizes first, but then the wave moves back up to depolarize the top of the ventricles which is in a direction away from lead II, causing a slight negative deflection on the ECG - an S wave. Together ventricular depolarization creates what is called the QRS complex.After tissue depolarizes, there is a brief period of time when there is no change in electrical activity - so the ECG goes back to the isoelectric line. The exact point at which it hits that line is called the J point, and for a brief time there is no net change in electrical activity, this is the ST segment. After that the ventricles have to repolarize or become negative once more - to reset itself in preparation for another wave of depolarization. Now, repolarization, moves in an overall direction upward, opposite the direction of lead 2, so you might think that that should be a negative deflection, but really it’s a positive deflection, since this time it’s a wave of negative charge, so essentially now when it’s moving opposite to lead II, it’s a positive deflection on ECG. And this final wave is called the T wave. The T wave is more spread out over time then the QRS complex because repolarization is a slower process that takes place at slightly different times for each cardiomyocyte instead of happening all at once like depolarization. It’s also worth mentioning that atrial repolarization doesn’t usually show up at all on the ECG because the small vectors created by it get lost in much larger vectors that get created by the the QRS complex.\n",

Essentially, when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection. This big, positive deflection corresponds to the wave moving down the septum. To read an ECG, there are a few key elements to keep in mind; one is to figure out the QRS transition.The chest leads will have a mostly positive deflection, if a depolarization wave is moving towards them. The QRS transition zone refers to where the QRS complex switches from being mostly negative to mostly positive, from the point of view of the chest leads, V1 through V6, which “view” the heart through the horizontal plane. The QRS transition usually happens in lead V3 or V4, depending on factors such as chest lead placement and the exact anatomy of a person’s heart. So, the QRS transition tells us when the overall QRS vector is aligned in the direction of the chest leads; it’s a way of understanding what’s happening to the QRS axis in the horizontal plane. If something alters the heart’s overall QRS vector, then the QRS transition zone can shift to the right, towards V1 and V2, or to the left, towards V5 and V6. For example, a myocardial infarction leads to the formation of scar tissue that can’t depolarize. Generally speaking, the QRS transition zone will shift away from a region of scar tissue, because it no longer contributes to the overall QRS vector. Consider the following: a blockage in the left circumflex artery can cause infarction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, which would lead to a rightward rotation of the QRS transition zone, toward V1 and V2. Another example would be cardiac hypertrophy, because a thicker muscular wall contributes more to the overall QRS vector. If it’s right ventricular hypertrophy, it would lead to a rightward rotation of the QRS transition zone, towards V1 and V2, similar to the result of an infarction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle. In contrast, a right ventricular infarction or a left ventricular hypertrophy would lead to a leftward rotation of the QRS transition zone, towards V5 and V6.\n",

Essentially, when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection. This big, positive deflection corresponds to the wave moving down the septum. To read an ECG, there are a few key elements to keep in mind; one is to figure out the axis. The axis of an ECG is the average direction of electrical movement through the heart during a depolarization. Specifically, axis usually refers to the mean QRS vector, which is the size and direction of the depolarization wave as it moves through the ventricles. Normally, the QRS axis aims downward and to the left in relation to the body. So, if we simplify this heart a bit, normally, the sinoatrial, or SA, node sends an electrical signal that propagates outward through the walls of the heart and contracts both upper chambers. Then, that signal moves to the atrioventricular, or AV, node, where the signal is delayed for a split second, and then goes down into the ventricles, or lower chambers. Here, it moves down the bundle of His into the left and right bundle branches, and into each ventricle’s Purkinje fibers, which causes them to contract as well. On an ECG, the atrial depolarization is seen as a P wave, the ventricular contraction is seen as a QRS complex, and the ventricular repolarization, a period of relaxation, is seen as a T wave. Keep in mind that a depolarization is caused by the movement of positive charge, so if this movement of positive charge is going toward the positive electrode, then it’s captured as a positive deflection on an ECG.With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at the mean, or average, QRS vector. After the depolarization wave arrives at the AV node, it travels down the interventricular septum and begins depolarizing the ventricles. The purkinje fibers sit just below the endocardium, which is the innermost layer of the heart. After the endocardium, there’s the myocardium, the cardiac muscle cells, and finally, the epicardium, which is the outer layer. Therefore, each purkinje fiber initiates a depolarization vector that travels directly outward; it starts in the endocardium, goes through the myocardium, and ends in the epicardium. Because they transmit a depolarization wave so quickly, they all fire off pretty much in unison. The more muscle tissue in the myocardial layer that a vector has to travel through, the large the size of the vector. So, as with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle gets thicker, you get bigger vectors. However, if the heart tissue has been damaged, such as from a heart attack, then you have smaller vectors, because the heart cells can’t depolarize anymore. The position of the diaphragm can also affect vectors, because it’s usually sort of sitting right up against the heart. In obese people, the diaphragm gets pushed upwards, rotating the heart further to the left. In thin people, the diaphragm lowers, rotating the heart a bit the other way. When everything is taken into consideration and all of the individual vectors are added up, there’s one overall representative vector arrow, which starts from the AV node, and points in one direction through the ventricles. Now, vectors can be broken down into two perpendicular vector components, so if you look at the component pointing at the positive lead electrode, that’s what is recorded on the ECG. Therefore, when you plot these vectors over the course of ventricular depolarization, the QRS complex emerges.  All right, to figure out the direction of the axis we can start by looking at lead I and aVF. Lead I moves from right to left across the heart, so anything pointing to the left will be positive in lead I; in contrast, aVF points downward, so any vector pointing downward will be positive in aVF. So, looking at our overall vector from before, it’s pointing both down and to the left, and both are positive. Thus, it’s in the bottom left quadrant between 0 and +90 degrees; that’s a normal axis. If it’s up in lead I and aVF, you can imagine it’s like seeing two thumbs up, which means that everything is okay! If the vector is positive in lead I and negative in aVF, then it’s in this quadrant; it could be normal if it’s between 0 and -30 degrees. However, if it’s between -30 and -90, it could be considered left axis deviation. Left axis deviation can happen when the left ventricle hypertrophies, or when the right ventricle becomes damaged and loses healthy tissue. If the opposite happens, and the vector is negative in lead I and positive in aVF, then it’s in this quadrant between +90 and +180 degrees; we call this right axis deviation. Right axis deviation can happen when the right ventricle hypertrophies, or when the left ventricle is damaged and loses healthy tissue. Finally, if the vector is negative in both lead I and aVF, then it’s a very rare case called extreme right axis deviation between -90 and +180 degrees. This can sometimes happen when there’s an ectopic focus that causes depolarization to start from the bottom of the ventricles, and travel in the reverse direction. It’s also a good idea to double check that the leads are placed correctly.  Now, you can figure out the QRS vector, within 30 degrees, by looking at someone’s ECGs. Specifically, to do so, you’ll look at the six leads, I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF, which correspond to 0 degrees, +60 degrees, +120 degrees, -150, -30, and +90, respectively. Here, lead I is clearly positive, which means that the axis is somewhere over here, and lead aVF is positive; this puts the axis in the lower left quadrant between 0 and +90 degrees, which is a normal axis. To be more precise, it looks like lead III is the closest to being isoelectric, which means equal positive and negative deflections; therefore, lead III must actually run perpendicular to the QRS vector, so 120 degrees subtract 90 degrees is the +30 degree line. Notice that this happens to sit on the same line as aVR, but in the opposite direction. We would think that this vector should look negative in aVR, and it does!Now, let’s switch gears and talk about the chest leads, which essentially view the heart in a different plane. Looking down at the heart we have leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. Normally, the QRS complex is negative in leads V1 and V2, isoelectric in lead V3 and V4, which is called the transition zone, and positive in leads V5 and V6. If the transition zone shifts toward V1 or V2, and looks isoelectric instead of negative, it suggests that the heart may be rotated to the person’s right, which can happen if the right ventricle is hypertrophied. On the other hand, if leads V5 or V6 look isoelectric instead of positive, it suggests that the heart may be rotated to the person’s left, which can happen if the left ventricle is hypertrophied.\n",
            "“Baro-“ means pressure or stretch, so baroreceptors are special nerve cells or receptors that sense blood pressure, by the way that the walls of the blood vessels stretch. That information is sent from the baroreceptors to the brain to help keep blood pressure balanced. Alright, baroreceptors are actually groups of nerve endings located within the blood vessel walls. and they can be classified into two types based on their location: the arterial ones and the cardiopulmonary ones. The arterial baroreceptors can be found on the wall of the aortic arch as well as on the wall of the carotid sinus, which is basically a bulge of the internal carotid artery just above its split from the common carotid artery in the neck. In the aortic arch, these nerve endings join up to form the vagus, or tenth (X) cranial nerve, and in the carotid sinus, they form the glossopharyngeal, or ninth (IX) cranial nerve. Both of these cranial nerves travel up towards the brainstem, carrying information about the stretch they sense in the arteries. They synapse at the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, which then relays the information to the cardiovascular centers. The cardiovascular centers are areas in the lower one-third of the pons and medulla oblongata of the brainstem, responsible for the autonomic or involuntary control of the cardiac and vascular function. They do that by coordinating the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. There are two main cardiovascular centers - the first is the vasomotor control center, which controls the diameter of the blood vessels, using the sympathetic nerve fibers to cause vasoconstriction. The second is the cardiac control center, which is further divided into the cardiac accelerator and cardiac decelerator centers. The cardiac accelerator center speeds up the heart rate and increases cardiac contractility through the sympathetic outflow tract, while the cardiac decelerator center slows down the heart rate through the parasympathetic outflow tract. Notice that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system affect the heart rate, but that only the sympathetic system has an effect on the diameter of the blood vessels and the contractility of the heart muscle. This whole process is known as the baroreceptor reflex, or baroreflex in short, and takes place in seconds to minutes, allowing us to rapidly adjust our blood pressure. Okay, so, as blood pulses through the carotid sinus and the aortic arch, the arterial walls get stretched out and in response, the baroreceptors start firing more nerve impulses up to those cardiovascular centers. The higher the pressure, the higher the frequency of nerve impulses. So, let’s say you’re running to catch the bus and your blood pressure rises. The increased pressure stretches the walls of the aortic arch and the carotid sinus, and the baroreceptors start firing at an increased frequency. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve carry that increased signal to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. To bring the pressure back down to normal, these centers inhibit the sympathetic and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous systems. Specifically, the vasomotor center decreases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system. In other words, the arterioles dilate, decreasing total peripheral arterial resistance, and there’s decreased constriction of veins, which allows blood to pool in the periphery rather than returning to the heart. Decreased venous return means there’s less preload - less diastolic filling of the heart - and that also decreases cardiac output. Meanwhile, remember that the cardiac accelerator center is also inhibited, reducing the sympathetic effect on the heart, and letting the heart work slower and less forcefully, in other words decreasing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again slows down the heart rate. Combined, these effects result in a decreased cardiac output (CO). Since blood pressure (BP), roughly equals cardiac output (CO) times total peripheral resistance (TPR), the decrease in cardiac output CO and the decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) means that blood pressure (BP) will decrease back down to normal as well. Hopefully, by that point, you’ve made the bus! On the flip side, let’s say that you’re in a terrible traumatic accident and start losing a lot of blood, causing your blood pressure to fall. The decreased pressure causes the walls of the aortic arch and carotid sinus to become less stretched, and the baroreceptors start firing less frequently. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve carry that decreased signal to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. To bring the pressure back up to normal, these centers stimulate the sympathetic and inhibit the parasympathetic nervous systems. Specifically, the vasomotor center increases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system. In other words, the arterioles narrow, increasing total peripheral arterial resistance, and there’s increased constriction of veins, which returns more blood to the heart rather than allowing it to pool in the periphery. Increased venous return means there’s more preload, and that also increases cardiac output. Meanwhile, remember that the cardiac accelerator center is also stimulated, increasing the sympathetic effect on the heart, and letting the heart work faster and more forcefully, in other words increasing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is deactivated, reducing the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again speeds up the heart rate. Combined, these effects result in an increased cardiac output (CO) and an increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR) which raises the blood pressure (BP) back to normal. In this case, these changes can save your life. Now, the other type of baroreceptors, called cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, are embedded within the walls of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery and veins. These are all relatively low-pressure areas, so the stretch of the walls mainly depends on the blood volume flowing through, or the “fullness” of these vessels. This is why these baroreceptors are mainly responsible for the regulation of blood volume and are also known as low- pressure or volume baroreceptors. If the blood volume increases, the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors start firing more frequently through the vagus nerve towards the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. These centers then send signals toward the heart, increasing its rate and, thus, the cardiac output. Increased cardiac output means more blood reaches the kidneys, so more water and sodium can get excreted, in an attempt to lower blood volume. This is called the Bainbridge reflex. In addition, when cardiopulmonary baroreceptors sense high blood volume, they also send their signal via the vagus nerve to the hypothalamus of the brain, telling it to reduce the production of vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone. This results in decreased water reabsorption from the kidney, letting more water get lost in the urine. Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors also stimulate the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide which comes from atrial muscle cells. ANP causes renal arterioles to dilate, allowing them to receive and filter even more blood, while also inhibiting water and sodium reabsorption. On the other hand, if the volume of blood decreases, cardiopulmonary baroreceptors get less stretched - reversing all of the effects. The heart rate slows down, more antidiuretic hormone is made, while less atrial natriuretic peptide is made. All this results in less water and sodium excretion, which helps restore blood volume.\n",
            "“Chemo-“ refers to the chemical composition of the blood, so chemoreceptors are special nerve cells or receptors that sense changes in the chemical composition of the blood. That information is sent from the chemoreceptors to the brain to help keep the cardiovascular and respiratory systems balanced. Alright, according to their location, chemoreceptors can be classified into two types: peripheral and central ones. Now, the peripheral chemoreceptors are so named because they live outside the brain. They are actually tiny bodies, or clusters of nerve cells and include the aortic body which sits along wall of the aortic arch, and the carotid body which is located at the point where each common carotid artery splits in the internal & external carotid arteries, running alongside the neck. Both the aortic and carotid bodies are bathed in arterial blood- and they carefully monitor changes in the concentration or partial pressure of oxygen, PO2 for short, but also in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2 for short, as well as the concentration of hydrogen ions, which determines blood pH. The aortic body sends this information along to the vagus, or tenth (X) cranial nerve, and the carotid body sends this information along to the glossopharyngeal, or ninth (IX) cranial nerve. These two large nerves travel up towards the respiratory centers which are in the brainstem. The respiratory centers are groups of neurons, located in the pons and medulla oblongata, that are responsible for the autonomic or involuntary control of breathing. The respiratory centers also communicate with the cardiovascular centers. The cardiovascular centers are areas in the lower one-third of the pons and medulla oblongata of the brainstem, responsible for the autonomic or involuntary control of the cardiac and vascular function. They do that by coordinating the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. There are two main cardiovascular centers - the first is the vasomotor control center, which controls the diameter of the blood vessels, using the sympathetic nerve fibers to cause vasoconstriction. The second is the cardiac control center, which is further divided into the cardiac accelerator and cardiac decelerator centers. The cardiac accelerator center speeds up the heart rate and increases cardiac contractility through the sympathetic outflow tract, while the cardiac decelerator center slows down the heart rate through the parasympathetic outflow tract. Notice that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system affect the heart rate, but that only the sympathetic system has an effect on the diameter of the blood vessels and the contractility of the heart muscle.  Okay, so, let’s say that you have hypoxemia, meaning a decrease in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, PO2, along with hypercapnia, an increase in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2, and acidemia, a decrease in blood pH. As blood pulses through the aortic arch and the common carotid, these changes get detected by the aortic and carotid bodies, which start firing more nerve impulses up through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves towards the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. In response, the vasomotor center increases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, causing arterioles to narrow, raising the total peripheral arterial resistance. In addition, the vasomotor center limits blood flow to peripheral organs, like the muscles, to help conserve oxygen for the brain and heart, and decreases the metabolic rate to help reduce carbon dioxide production. There’s also increased constriction of veins, which returns more blood to the heart rather than allowing it to pool in the periphery. Increased venous return means there’s more preload, and that also increases cardiac output. Now another effect, is that the cardiac accelerator center gets inhibited, reducing the sympathetic effect on the heart, so that it can work slower and less forcefully, in other words decreasing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again slows down the heart rate. This last bit might seem counterintuitive, but stay tuned. Now, it turns out that peripheral chemoreceptors also send impulses through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves which reach the respiratory centers of the brainstem. And they cause you to suck in more oxygen and blow off more carbon dioxide, by getting the diaphragm and chest wall muscles to breathe faster and deeper. Now, this causes airways to get stretched, and that’s detected by another type of receptors, called pulmonary stretch receptors, which are located in the smooth muscles lining the trachea and central bronchi. Once stretched, these receptors start firing through the vagus nerve back to the pons and medulla, where they tell the respiratory centers to slow down. At the same time, though, they stimulate the cardiac accelerator center and, thus, the sympathetic effect on the heart, increasing the heart rate and contractility, while inhibiting the cardiac decelerator center and thus, the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again helps the heart rate speed up. In other words, they reverse the direct effects that the peripheral chemoreceptors had on the cardiac centers. Ultimately, this makes the heart work faster and stronger, letting the cardiac output CO and blood pressure BP rise, which is essential to push more blood to the lungs, so that it gets supplied with oxygen and freed from the excess carbon dioxide. Now, peripheral chemoreceptors work in concert with the central chemoreceptors, which take their name from the fact that they are a part of the central nervous system, particularly of the brain. Central chemoreceptors are clusters of neurons packed together in the ventral or frontal surface of the medulla oblongata, at the base of the brain, right next to the respiratory centers themselves. The central chemoreceptors are bathed in cerebrospinal fluid, and they sample that fluid to assess for changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2 and pH. That’s different from the peripheral chemoreceptors, which are primarily sensitive to changes in the partial pressure of oxygen or PO2. When the partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2 rises in the blood, carbon dioxide molecules rapidly diffuse across the blood-brain barrier and build up into the cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid is mainly composed of water, so carbon dioxide (CO2) binds to water (H2O) molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), and that rapidly breaks down into hydrogen (H+) ions and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).CO2 + H2O    <->     H2CO3      <->      H+ + HCO3-.As hydrogen H+ ions build up, too, the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid starts to drop. So, both the increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2 and the decreased pH, trigger the central chemoreceptors to stimulate the nearby respiratory centers to increase the respiratory drive. Now, what makes central chemoreceptors special, is that, due to their location, they are also influenced by changes in blood flow to the brain. Imagine, for example, that there is a large mass inside the head which raises the intracranial pressure, squashing the blood vessels heading in and out of the brain and causing brain ischemia. This means all that carbon dioxide CO2 that gets released by the brain cells as a byproduct of their metabolic processes, can’t escape through blood flow, so inevitably, starts accumulating cerebrospinal spinal, or CSF, also decreasing its pH. Once again, this get detected by the central chemoreceptors, which, via the vasomotor center, leads to arteriolar and venous constriction, redirecting more blood flow to the brain. That increases total peripheral resistance (TPR) which raises the blood pressure (BP), helping the blood pressure to stay higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure so that blood can continue to flow to the brain. This increase in blood pressure in response to increased intracranial pressure is called the Cushing reaction, named after the neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing.\n",
            "According to the world health organization, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, as well as in the US. Of those, a large proportion are caused by heart attacks, also known as acute myocardial infarctions, or just myocardial infarctions, sometimes just called MI.   The word infarction means that some area of tissue has died due to a lack of blood flow, and therefore a lack of oxygen. “Myo” refers to the muscle, and “cardial” refers to the heart tissue. So with a heart attack, or MI, you have death of heart muscle cells because of a lack in blood flow, a process called necrosis. Now the heart’s main job is to pump blood to your body’s tissues right? Well, the heart also needs blood, and so it also pumps blood to itself, using the coronary circulation. The coronary circulation is this system of small arteries and veins that help keep the heart cells supplied with fresh oxygen. Heart attacks happen when these small arteries become blocked and stop supplying blood to the heart tissue, and if this happens for long enough, heart tissue dies.  Almost all heart attacks are ultimately a result of endothelial cell dysfunction, which relates to anything that irritates or inflames the slippery inner lining of the artery—the tunica intima. One classic irritant are the toxins found in tobacco which float around in the blood and damage these cells. That damage then becomes a site for atherosclerosis, a type of coronary artery disease where deposits of fat, cholesterol, proteins, calcium, and white blood cells build up and start to block blood flow to the heart tissue. This mound of stuff has two parts to it, the soft cheesy-textured interior and the hard outer shell which is called the fibrous cap. Collectively this whole thing’s ominously called plaque. Usually, though, it takes years for plaque to build up, and this slow blockage only partially blocks the coronary arteries, and so even though less blood makes it to heart tissue, there’s still blood. Heart attacks happen when there’s a sudden complete blockage or occlusion of a coronary artery—so let’s see how that can happen. Since these plaques sit right in the lumen of the blood vessel, they’re constantly being stressed by mechanical forces from blood flow, and interestingly it’s often the smaller plaques with softer caps rather than the larger ones with harder caps that are especially prone to break or get ripped off. Once that happens the inner cheesy filling which remember is this mix of fat, cholesterol, proteins, calcium, and white blood cells, is thrombogenic, and this means that it tends to form clots very quickly. So platelets, or blood-clotting components in the blood, flow by and get excited; and they adhere to the exposed cheesy material. In addition to piling up, the platelets also release chemicals that enhance the clotting process. Now this happens super fast, think about how quickly a small cut stops bleeding, that’s a very similar process—it happens in a matter of minutes, right? And now that coronary artery is fully occluded.So now let’s change views a bit, If we take a slice of the heart like this, this side being posterior, or back, and this being anterior, or the front, with the left and right ventricles here, and then we have the three most commonly blocked arteries—the left anterior descending, or LAD which supplies blood to the anterior wall and septum of the left ventricle which accounts for 40-50% of cases, the right coronary artery, or the RCA which covers the posterior wall, septum and papillary muscles of the left ventricle—accounts for about 30-40% of cases, and finally, the left circumflex artery, or LCX which supplies to the lateral wall of the left ventricle —about 15-20% of cases. Notice that the majority of these areas supply the left ventricle—most heart attacks therefore involve the left ventricle, where the right ventricle and both atria—the upper chamber—aren’t as often affected.  Each of these areas is called the artery’s zone of perfusion. And, if we take a closer look at one of these zones, we’ll see that basically you’ve got the endocardium, which is the smooth membrane on the inside of the heart, and then the myocardium, all the heart muscle, and then, the epicardium, the outer surface of the heart, which is where the coronary arteries live. Let’s say the LAD gets blocked, the area of perfusion is now at serious risk, and within about a minute, the muscle cells in this zone don’t see enough oxygen and become ischemic, and the muscle layer’s ability to contract is severely reduced. This initial stage is extremely sensitive, since the ischemic damage to cells in the perfusion zone is potentially reversible. After about 20-40 minutes, though, damage starts to become irreversible and the cells start to die, and this zone changes to a zone of necrosis, or dead tissue. Once lost, these cells will never return or regrow—that’s why quickly identifying and treating an MI quickly is super important.  The first area affected is the inner third of the myocardium, since it’s farthest from the coronary artery and the last area to receive blood, and it’s subject to higher pressures from inside the heart. If the blockage suddenly lyses or breaks down and blood flow returns, sometimes patients’ damage will be limited to the inner third, and this would be called a subendocardial infarct. An ECG, or electrocardiogram, done at this point typically shows an ST-segment depression, or in other words, it doesn’t show ST segment elevation, so sometimes we call this an NSTEMI which stands for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.Other causes of this sort of subendocardial infarcts would be severe atherosclerosis and hypotension—anything that ultimately leads to poor perfusion of the heart tissue. After about 3 to 6 hours, though, the zone of necrosis extends through the entire wall thickness, called a transmural infarct, which this time shows up as ST-segment elevation on ECG, which is why they’re sometimes called STEMIs, or ST elevation myocardial infarctions. So the difference between NSTEMIs and STEMIs is that NSTEMIs don’t have ST-segment elevation, and these are caused by partial infarct of the wall, whereas STEMIs have ST-segment elevation and involve the whole wall thickness.  Patients that have an MI will most commonly have severe and crushing chest pain or pressure, that might radiate up to the left arm or jaw, they might have diaphoresis or sweating, nausea, fatigue, and dyspnea. All of these are either a direct result of an end-organ like the heart or the brain not getting enough perfusion—so think chest pain and dizziness. Or from the sympathetic response from the body to help the heart work harder and preserve blood pressure—so think sweating and clammy skin. Many people also have referred pain where the nerves in the heart are irritated, but that pain can be felt in the jaw, shoulder, arm, or back instead.   In addition to an ECG, labs can be very useful in diagnosing an MI. When there’s been irreversible damage to heart cells, their membranes become damaged and the proteins and enzymes inside escape, and can enter the bloodstream. Three key ones are troponin I, Troponin T, and CK-MB, which is a combination of creatine kinase enzymes M and B. d Both troponin I and T levels can be elevated in the blood within 2-4 hours after infarction, and usually peak around 48 hours, but stay elevated for 7-10 days. CK-MB starts to rise 2-4 hours after infarction, peaks around 24 hours, and returns to normal after 48 hours. Since CK-MB returns to normal more quickly, it can be useful to diagnose reinfarction, a second infarction that happens after 48 hours but before troponin levels go back to normal. A second heart attack happens following 10% of MIs.  A major complication with MIs are arrhythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms, with the highest risk being immediately following an MI, since the damage or injury can disrupt how the cells conduct electrical signals. Kind of along the same lines, depending on how much contractile or muscle tissue is affected, patients’ hearts might not be able to pump enough blood to the body, resulting in cardiogenic shock. In the days following an infarction, the tissue around the infarcted area becomes inflamed and is invaded by neutrophils, which can lead to pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium. In the next couple weeks, macrophages invade the tissue, and the healing process begins with the formation of granulation tissue, which is new connective tissue that’s yellow and soft. At this phase, the tissue’s most at risk of myocardial rupture. After 2 weeks to several months, the cardiac tissue scarring process finishes, and the resulting tissue becomes grayish-white in color. Since the scar tissue doesn’t help pump blood, over time the remaining heart muscle can grow or change shape to try and compensate for these lost cells and pump harder, but they ultimately continue to fail, which can lead to heart failure.   Now a potentially life-saving treatment that can be performed immediately following an MI, is fibrinolytic therapy, which uses medications to break down fibrin in blood clots. An angioplasty might also be done, which is a minimally invasive endovascular procedure where a deflated balloon inserted into the blockage then inflated to open the artery up. And finally a percutaneous coronary intervention might also be performed, where a tiny catheter is used to place a stent in the coronary artery to physically open up a blood vessel. Each of these focuses on re-establishing blood flow to the the dying heart heart cells—since time is tissue. If early enough following blockage, some of these cells that haven’t entered into the irreversible stage can be salvaged and saved, while the others will be destroyed and removed. This can improve both short and long-term function as well as prevent further damage and reduce the overall zone of necrosis.   Now an important complication of re-establishing perfusion, or reperfusion therapy, is reperfusion injury, where tissue is damaged by returning blood flow. And, this is thought to happen because of a couple mechanisms. First, blood flowing back to cells brings this influx of calcium, and since calcium leads to muscle contraction, the irreversibly damaged cells contract, and since they’ve been irreversibly damaged, they get stuck like that and can’t relax. This shows up on histology as this characteristic contraction band necrosis. Also though, blood brings along oxygen, right? Yeah it does. But, that oxygen, paradoxically, can actually lead to more cellular damage. The conditions in an ischemic heart seem to cause an increased conversion of the returning oxygen to reactive oxygen species, which go on to damage more heart cells.  In addition to reestablishing blood flow though, there are a number of medications that might be given in the acute setting including antiplatelet meds like aspirin, anticoagulants like heparin, nitrates which relax the coronary arteries and help lower preload, beta blockers that slow down the heart rate and thereby cardiac demand, pain medication to help relieve the discomfort, and statins which help improve a patient’s lipid profile. Now there are many individual factors to consider when it comes to acute management of a myocardial infarction, and of course many long term issues to consider as well—the most important of which is to address the underlying risk factors like an improved diet and quitting smoking.\n",
            "Vascular refers to the blood vessels, and peripheral means the outer limits or edge of something, which in peripheral vascular disease refers to any vessels that aren’t supplying the heart or the brain, like ones in the legs, arms, or other organs. Peripheral vascular disease happens when one of these arteries becomes narrowed, which reduces blood flow; this often affects the limbs.Peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, usually involves the arteries, so sometimes it’s also referred to as peripheral artery disease or PAD. PVD is usually caused by a blockage, called organic PVD, that is most commonly created by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of lipids and fibrous material just under the inner lining of the blood vessel, called the tunica intima. When plaque builds up, it narrows the artery, which reduces perfusion to whatever tissue it tends to supply; this buildup usually happens over the course of many years. However, the vessel could be blocked by an embolus, which can happen suddenly if a blood clot from some upstream artery lodges in a peripheral artery; this clot would obviously stop blood flow from getting to the tissue the vessel supplies.   Besides organic PVDs, there are also functional PVDs. With functional PVDs, blood vessels stop blood flow by changing diameter, such as with vasospasms, where the vessel constricts and blood flow is reduced. This type of PVD is usually short term, and can come and go.  The arteries supplying the legs are the most commonly affected vessels in peripheral vascular disease. When less blood gets to the muscle tissue in the legs, the tissue receives less oxygen and becomes ischemic. Ischemic cells release adenosine, a type of signaling molecule, which is thought to affect nerves in these areas; this is felt as pain. This pain in the legs is often referred to as claudication. Sometimes, even though blood flow is narrowed with PVD, when a person is at rest, there’s enough of blood to meet the tissue’s demands; thus, people are often asymptomatic during rest.   However, if the person is walking or exercising, then the leg muscles start to work harder and demand more oxygen; demand becomes greater than what’s supplied, which causes the claudication, or pain. The location of the pain is a clue to which artery is involved. If it’s in the hips and the buttocks, think of lower aorta or iliac. If it’s the thigh, think of the iliac or common femoral artery. For the upper 2/3 of the calf, think of the superficial femoral artery; for the lower ⅓ of the calf, think of the popliteal artery. Finally, for the foot, think of the tibial or peroneal artery.   Other symptoms include leg or foot wounds, or ulcers, that don’t heal up normally, and color changes of focal areas of the skin. For example, if the leg’s been affected, the foot might turn pale white when it’s raised; this “elevation pallor” happens because gravity works against blood flowing to the lower extremities, which already has a hard time getting through the narrowed artery.   Likewise, the foot might turn red when it’s lowered, which is called dependent rubor, because gravity is working with the blood flow in this direction. We can see that gravity seriously starts to affect blood flow in the affected arteries. As the arterial blockage gets bigger, less and less blood gets to the tissues, which can lead to more serious complications. First, “rest pain” describes a continuous burning or pain in the forefoot and toes when the legs are elevated; this pain is relieved when the limbs are lowered, such as by hanging the feet over the bed or walking around the room, because doing so allows more blood to get down to the foot. If the blockage is severe enough, the limb might be at risk of gangrene, or death of the tissue, because if deprived of oxygen for long enough, the cells can actually die, or necrose. If this happens, the dead tissue would likely have to be removed, and in some cases, the limb would have to be amputated.  The major risk factors and causes of peripheral vascular disease are the same as those for atherosclerosis because they are similar processes. Remember, atherosclerosis in the neck arteries can cause a stroke, and if involved in the coronary arteries, can cause a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Smoking seems to be the biggest contributor to PVD. Other diseases and conditions that are also linked to a higher risk of PVD include: diabetes; dyslipidemia, or an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood; and hypertension.  Diagnosing PVD usually involves listening to the pulse in the iliac arteries of the legs with a stethoscope. Because that artery has been narrowed, it can make a whooshing sound, called a bruit. Another test that can be done is a doppler ultrasound, which is a noninvasive way of visualizing blood flow. The most common test to diagnose PVD is the ankle-brachial index, or ABI, where blood pressure is taken in the ankle and in the arm, and then compared. PVD is typically diagnosed if the systolic blood pressure in the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure in the arm is less than 0.9. In general, claudication is often seen in people with an ABI between 0.4 and 0.9. Rest pain is likely present if an ABI is between 0.2 and 0.4. Tissue loss, ulcers, and gangrene are likely if an ABI is between 0 to 0.4.  Treating PVD often requires significant lifestyle changes that address the underlying risk factors, such as quitting smoking, adopting healthy eating habits, and exercising regularly. Sometimes in addition to these changes, people with PVD will also get certain medications that aim to reduce the likelihood of blood clotting and obstruction of the blood vessels.  Surgical intervention, like angioplasty or bypass surgery, is rarely needed.\n",
            "The word “aneurysm” comes from the Greek word aneurysma, meaning “dilation.” This  makes sense because aneurysms are defined as abnormal dilations in a blood vessel. A bulge in a blood vessel is officially labelled as an aneurysm when the diameter of the bulge is approximately one and a half times larger than the normal diameter of the blood vessel.Aneurysms can happen to any blood vessel in your body, including the aorta, the femoral artery, the iliac artery, the popliteal artery, and the cerebral arteries. They can also happen in your veins too, but those are less common as blood pressure in veins is much, much lower than in the arteries.   There are two major categories of aneurysms: true aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. In true aneurysms, all the layers of the blood vessel wall dilate together. True aneurysms that balloon out symmetrically on all sides of the blood vessel are called fusiform aneurysms, whereas asymmetrically shaped aneurysms balloon out on  one side of the blood vessel. This asymmetrical shape usually happens because for some reason one side of the blood vessel wall experiences higher blood pressure than the rest of the vessel wall, or because the wall was weaker on one side to begin with. Asymmetrical true aneurysms can be called either “saccular” or “berry” aneurysms. Pseudoaneurysms, on the other hand, are like false aneurysms because they are not actually aneurysms at all. They are caused by a small hole in your blood vessel which allows blood to leak out of the vessel and form a pool of blood that looks like a fusiform or berry aneurysm depending on where the hole is and its size. The blood pools because the surrounding tissues act as walls that contain the blood in one spot.Arterial aneurysms occur most commonly in the aorta with about 60% of true aortic aneurysms happening in the abdominal section of the aorta, and the other 40% happening in the thoracic section. Of all the abdominal aortic aneurysms, you can find about 95% of them just below the point where the renal arteries branch off from the abdominal aorta but above the aortic bifurcation. This is because there is naturally less elastin[a] in the walls of this section of the aorta.  Aneurysms are caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, so anything (really anything!), that causes the wall to weaken can cause an aneurysm. When a blood vessel wall weakens, it struggles to contain the pressure of the blood pushing against the walls so the diameter of the blood vessel lumen increases. On top of this, pressure on the blood vessel walls increases as the diameter of the lumen also increases, thanks to LaPlace’s law. This makes the aneurysm diameter even bigger, creating a cycle of continuous bulging. You’ve likely experienced this when you blow up a balloon. The first breath into the balloon is tough, but the next several breaths are pretty easy. This positive feedback loop is why aneurysms usually get bigger over time.  So what underlying conditions might weaken the wall of blood vessels? Well one way is if all the layers of those blood vessel walls don’t receive oxygen. Typically, the cells of the vessel walls are able to get oxygen from blood as it flows by. However, in the first section of the aorta, where the walls are super thick and muscular in order to handle all that blood pressure coming from the heart, the cells need to have their own set of blood vessels that supply the tunica media and the tunica externa. We call these special blood vessels vasa vasorum.   In hypertension, the vasa vasorum can develop hyaline arteriolosclerosis, narrowing their lumen, and causing ischemia. This leads to atrophy of the smooth muscle of the tunica media, and overall all, weakening in the aortic wall.  The same thing can happen in blood vessels without vasa vasorum if we have a bunch of plaque building up on the tunica intima thanks to our friendly neighbourhood atherosclerosis. Oxygen just can’t penetrate all the vessel’s walls. You see this type of aneurysm often in the abdominal aorta, where blood pressure is high and the aorta walls are nourished by passing blood. If you think about this it’s no wonder, then, why both aneurysms and atherosclerosis share similar risk factors: usually people who are male, who are over the age of 60, who have hypertension, and who smoke.If we look at tertiary syphilis, it affects the vasa vasorum as syphilis causes inflammation in the tunica intima of the vasa vasorum (which again are those blood vessels that deliver oxygen to the thick walls of larger blood vessels). This ultimately leads to a narrower lumen and restricts blood supply to the vessel walls of the thoracic aorta, causing atrophy. By the way, the name for this vasa vasorum inflammation is endarteritis obliterans. If you were to look at the vasa vasorum in tertiary syphilis, you’d see the inflammation causes fibrosis and scarring on the walls creating this cool to look at, but less cool to have, tree-bark like texture.Other bacterial infections can also cause aneurysms, which we label as mycotic aneurysms. The bacteria from an infection somewhere else in the body can break off from the main infection and travel around in the blood. Usually these embolic bacteria will get stuck in the intracranial arteries, visceral arteries, or the arteries feeding the arms and legs. There, the bacteria enter and weaken the blood vessel walls leading to, you guessed it, an aneurysm. Some of the bacteria that commonly cause mycotic aneurysms are, and these can be tricky to pronounce so bare with me, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anything in the Salmonella species. You’ll also see mycotic aneurysms are a complication of infective endocarditis. However, infection leading to aneurysm is not limited to just bacteria. Infection from the fungi Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucor are also a common cause of mycotic aneurysms.Genetic disorders affecting your body’s ability to properly form connective tissue like fibrillin or collagen also weaken the blood vessel walls. For example, people with Marfan syndrome have weakened blood vessel walls because the elastic properties found within fibrillin is impaired, and people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are more likely to develop aneurysms because their ability to form collagen proteins is disrupted.  Alrighty then, so intact aneurysms are usually okay, and don’t cause any symptoms. I say usually because the bulging blood vessel can compress other organs or vessels around it. If an aneurysm compressed a major vein like the inferior or superior vena cava, it could decrease the amount of blood returning to the heart.   Usually though, the big worry with aneurysms is the possibility that they might explode, or more like rupture, but it’s more fun to say explode. When an aneurysm ruptures, it’s like having a water main break: blood is spewing out from the hole in the blood vessel and less blood is flowing downstream to the cells that need it, which causes ischemia in that downstream tissue.  In thoracic aneurysms specifically, a very serious complication can occur if the aneurysm is right above the aortic valve. As the aneurysm dilates, it pulls on the walls around the aortic valve preventing the aortic valve from closing properly.This allows blood from within the aorta to flow back into the ventricle during ventricular diastole. This particular condition is called aortic insufficiency, and can also cause a high-pitched, brassy like cough because the left recurrent laryngeal nerve which wraps around the aorta is stretched by the expanding diameter of the aorta. I don’t have that audio clip for that brassy cough sound, but it’s pretty distinct when you hear it.Moving on to the brain. If an aneurysm ruptures in the brain, blood will pool into the subarachnoid space putting pressure on the brain tissue and irritating the meninges, which cause symptoms like a very sudden and intense headache, and the inability for someone to flex their neck forward. Another point on the list of terrible things aneurysms can cause is blood clots. As blood flows past the aneurysm, some of the blood might pull over into the extra lumen space caused by the aneurysm itself. This blood isn’t being pushed along the blood vessel as quickly as the rest of the blood, and when blood stays still for too long, it likes to clot. Given enough time, the blood clot might become so big it blocks off the entire blood vessel causing tissue ischemia.It could break into smaller pieces called emboli and get wedged in a smaller blood vessel, also causing ischemia.   As an aside, it’s kind of nifty that the clotting property of blood is really useful to stop blood from leaking out of our blood vessels, but it just also happens to be really really deadly if it stops the blood from moving altogether. Honestly, blood coagulation could be the plot for the third installment of the Speed movies.Okay, back on track. Abdominal aortic aneurysms sometimes have signs and symptoms, and sometimes they don’t, even if the aneurysm has ruptured. Really severe pain in the left flank (which includes the abdomen, chest, lower back, and the groin), a pulsating mass that is in time with the heartbeat somewhere in this painful region, and hypotension occur in about 50% of aneurysms that have ruptured and are considered the classical signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Thoracic aortic aneurysms usually don’t have any symptoms, although sometimes they can cause severe chest, back, and abdominal pain.Aneurysms can be asymptomatic, and are sometimes diagnosed incidentally when an individual gets an imaging study for another reason. Usually they’re seen best on an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. If an aneurysm is present and large enough to cause risk to an individual, it can be treated surgically.\n",
            "An aortic dissection is where part of the tunica intima (which is the endothelial, or the innermost layer of a blood vessel) of the aorta is ripped off. What happens is a tear in the tunica intima of the aorta forms, and the high-pressured blood flowing through the aorta begins to tunnel between the tunica intima and the tunica media, separating the two layers. This is widely accepted as an unideal situation.Now as the high-pressured blood continues to shear more and more of the tunica intima off the tunica media, blood starts to pool between the two layers, increasing the outside diameter of the blood vessel. The area where blood collects between the tunica intima and the media is called a false lumen, and the true lumen is the regular lumen of the blood vessel.Since high pressure is a cause of aortic dissection, it’s no surprise that the aorta is the prime target for this problem. So what causes aortic dissections? Well, chronic hypertension is the major cause, whether the hypertension is caused by stress or from increased blood plasma volume like in pregnancy. Blood vessel coarctation, which is the narrowing of a blood vessel, also can cause  dissection. Aortic dissections most often happen in the first 10 cm of the the aorta closest to the heart. In order for an aortic dissection to occur, an underlying condition usually has to exist that weakens the aorta’s wall. Connective tissue disorders like Marfan’s and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause a dissection, as well as a decreased blood flow to the vasa vasorum. Aneurysms can be a cause of aortic dissection as well, and incidentally dissection can also cause aneurysms because again, the dissection weakens the blood vessel wall.In other words, weak walls can lead to outpouching of the blood vessel or a break in the tunica intima, and both of these weaken the walls further.Aortic dissections cause a whole wack load of other problems too. A lot of complications are related to where the blood in the false lumen flows. The blood could flow back up the aorta to the heart and enter the heart’s pericardial space, filling it with blood and causing pericardial tamponade, a really really bad and potentially fatal situation. The blood flowing through the false lumen could also puncture a hole through the tunica media and tunica externa and bleed into the mediastinum, which would kill you really fast cause that’s a lot of blood leaving the vascular system quickly. The tunneling blood could also puncture a hole in the tunica intima and return into the true lumen which isn’t great but hey all things considered, it could be worse.Yet another possibility is the blood could continue to tunnel between the tunica intima and the tunica media until it reaches another artery that branches off the aorta, like the renal arteries or the subclavian arteries. The blood in the false lumen can put pressure on these branching arteries decreasing blood flow to the kidneys and arms, causing a whole new mess to deal with. The main symptoms of aortic dissection are sharp chest pains that often radiate to the back. A person might also develop weak pulses in downstream arteries like the brachial or femoral arteries or sometimes there may be differences in blood pressure between the left and right arm. An aortic dissection is an emergency, because it can lead to hypotension, or low blood pressure as well as shock if there’s rupture and significant blood loss.On a chest X-ray, there’s typically a widened aorta. More sensitive imaging techniques that are commonly used include a transesophageal echocardiogram, which is where an ultrasound probe is passed through the esophagus to obtain a clear picture of the aorta. There’s also CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography - both of which look closely at the blood vessels. An aortic dissection needs to be treated immediately. Often this is done surgically, where a surgeon takes out as much of the dissected aorta as possible and blocks the entry of blood into the wall of the aorta. The aortic wall is then reconstructed with synthetic graft, and sometimes that graft is propped open with a wire mesh stent. Beyond surgery, blood pressure medications, like beta blockers may be given to reduce blood pressure.\n",
            "Kawasaki disease isn’t related to the motorcycle and engine company, other than that Japan was where the disease was first described and where the company was founded. Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, or an inflammation of the blood vessels, that mostly affects the coronary arteries, but can also affect any large- or medium-sized arteries. With Kawasaki disease, the immune system attacks the arteries. It’s not entirely known why this happens, although some theories suggest it has an infectious cause; autoimmune reactions and genetic predisposition probably play a part as well. Whatever the case, when the endothelial cells in the blood vessels are attacked, they become damaged, exposing the underlying collagen and tissue factor found in the middle layer of the blood vessel, or the tunica media. This leads to a few serious problems. First, these exposed materials increase the chance of blood coagulation. When blood coagulates, it forms clots that can block blood flow in the coronary arteries, leading to ischemia of the heart muscle. Secondly, damaged endothelial cells in coronary arteries mean weak artery walls, which can lead to coronary aneurysms. These aneurysms form because fibrin is deposited into the blood vessel wall as part of the healing process. Fibrin makes the vessel stiffer, less elastic, and unable to gently stretch with high arterial pressures; therefore, the arteries develop permanent bulges that we call aneurysms. Aneurysms 8mm or larger are at the most risk of rupturing, which reduces blood flow to the heart; this causes ischemia, and potentially myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Thirdly, in some cases, this fibrosis doesn’t lead to aneurysms; instead, fibrosis of the blood vessels makes the vessel walls thicker, which reduces the lumen diameter and restricts blood flow. If blood flow is restricted or reduced, again, the heart might become ischemic, leading to heart attack.  Kawasaki disease is most commonly seen in infants and children under five years old, and is more likely to affect boys. This disease is self-limited, which means that the inflammation will resolve after six to eight weeks, but if we left it untreated, there is a 20-25% risk of  developing the heart complications mentioned earlier. We rarely see any cardiac symptoms in the first few weeks, unless the patient has an underlying heart condition already; otherwise, cardiac symptoms typically evolve later. These are the classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease: conjunctivitis with limbus sparing, which means red eyes with a white margin right around the iris; a rash that might extend across multiple parts of the body, which starts polymorphous, but later desquamates, or flakes off; adenopathy, or enlarged lymph nodes, especially concerning the cervical lymph nodes; a strawberry tongue, which is when the top layer of cells on the tongue slough off, giving the tongue a very red, strawberry-like appearance; their mouth and throat may also look very red; their lips might become dry and cracked; their hands and feet might develop a rash and swell; and finally, they might have five or more days of high fever that typically doesn’t resolve with antipyretics. Just remember that these patients C-R-A-S-H and burn.Now, there isn’t a specific test to diagnose Kawasaki disease, but there are a number of lab tests that can provide clues. At the beginning of the disease, many patients are anemic and have an increased number of white blood cells with a “shift to the left,” which means that there are more immature white blood cells than normal. They’ll also have an increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and increased liver enzymes; these are all good clues telling us that some sort of inflammation is happening. Microscopic urinalysis will show mononuclear white blood cells in the urine without evidence of bacteria. After a few weeks, the patient’s platelet count also typically rises. That was a lot of tests, but one last test that we’d want to do is an echocardiogram to take a look at the coronary artery and the heart muscle, to see if any of the heart complications we talked about earlier are happening.Kawasaki disease is diagnosed based on a combination of patient symptoms and lab tests. In order for Kawasaki disease to be diagnosed, patients need four of the five CRASH symptoms we talked about earlier, in addition to a fever that lasts five or more days. Sometimes, however, patients don’t meet this these[a] strict criteria. Vasculitis in the coronary arteries is a definitive sign that the patient has Kawasaki disease, but you probably wouldn’t want to wait to find that out, right? People who don’t perfectly meet all the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease are sometimes classified as having incomplete Kawasaki disease. There are guidelines in place to help healthcare providers figure out if they should treat these atypical cases as Kawasaki disease or not, but just keep in mind that it’s possible to have cases that don’t meet all the clinical diagnostic requirements.   Treating Kawasaki disease is also helpful diagnostically, because if the therapy works, then it also reassures you that the right diagnosis was made. The main treatment is to give IVIG, which is an antibody taken from other individuals. It’s thought that this actually helps to calm down the immune system and reduce inflammation. We also give ASA, otherwise known as acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin, because aspirin inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase, which prevents platelets from aggregating together. Wait a second! There should be alarm bells going off, right? We’re not supposed to give aspirin to kids because they could develop Reye syndrome, which is encephalopathy and serious liver injury, and therefore bad news. Kawasaki’s disease is also bad news though, so we take the risk and monitor the child very carefully.\n",
            "Coarctation is a fancy way of saying “narrowing,” so a coarctation of the aorta means a narrowing of the aorta. If we look at the heart, we’ve got the right and left atria, the right and left ventricles, the pulmonary artery leaving the right ventricle to go to the lungs, and the aorta leaving the left ventricle to go to the body.   There are two forms of aortic coarctation to be familiar with: an “infant” form and an “adult” form. With the infant form, which accounts for about 70% of cases, the coarctation comes after the aortic arch, which branches off to the upper extremities and to the head, and before the ductus arteriosus. Now, you might be thinking, “Hey, what’s this ductus arteriosus thing doing here?” Well, typically this guy only exists during fetal development and closes after birth, but with infantile coarctation, the ductus arteriosus is usually still open, or patent, so there’s a patent ductus arteriosus. In fact, sometimes this form is also called preductal coarctation.  So, if we draw out a more simplified version of the heart, we’ve got deoxygenated blood coming into the right atrium that flows into the right ventricle. Now, as it’s pumped out of the pulmonary artery, it’s got two choices, right? One option is to go through the patent ductus arteriosus and continue down the aorta; the other option is to continue down the way it’s going. Well, since it’s higher pressure over here on the left side, you might think that the blood would say “thanks, but no thanks,” and keep going down the lower pressure pulmonary artery. Instead, this aortic coarctation adds a little twist. Since the spot right before the ductus arteriosus is narrower, blood flowing from the left side has a harder time going through, so actually there’s high pressure upstream of the coarctation, but low pressure downstream. So, what happens is that blood decides to go this way, through the patent ductus arteriosus and into the lower pressure area in the systemic circulation, and then continues down to the lower extremities, rather than the slightly higher pressure pulmonary artery. This gives you a real sense of exactly how much this coarctation reduces the pressure over on the systemic side.   Since deoxygenated blood is going to the lower extremities, infants typically present with lower extremity cyanosis, meaning a bluish or purplish discoloration of the lower limbs, which is often present even at birth. This is a really important thing to catch, because without intervention, these infants often don’t survive past the neonatal period. Infantile coarctation is something that happens during fetal development, and can occur on its own or can be associated with other congenital changes. It’s worth mentioning that it’s highly associated with Turner syndrome, a genetic abnormality where females only have one X chromosome instead of two.All right, this brings us to adult coarctation, which accounts for the other 30% of cases, and typically develops, well, as an adult. Compared to infantile coarctation, in this type there usually isn’t a patent ductus arteriosus; instead, it’s been long since closed off and is now known as the ligamentum arteriosum. The coarctation usually happens in adults just distal to this ligament. So, now there’s no mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, but just like in infantile coarctation, the pressure is increased before the coarctation, because blood has a harder time squeezing through this narrowed artery, and it’s going to be lower downstream from the coarctation.  This causes both upstream and downstream issues. Upstream issues include blood flow increases into the aortic branches, and thus blood pressure increases in the upper extremities and the head. Increased cerebral blood flow means an increased risk of berry aneurysms, which happen when weak spots along blood vessels in the brain balloon out from the high pressures and become tiny sacs filled with blood. This increased pressure also tends to cause the aorta and aortic valve to dilate, or get larger, and the increased pressure means the aorta is at risk of aortic dissection, or tearing of the inner layer of the aorta.   Now, let’s look at downstream issues. Because blood flow downstream from the constriction is decreased, there’ll be decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and patients will have a weak pulse in those lower extremities. Since blood pressure’s lower, patients sometimes experience claudication in their legs, which is pain and cramping due to reduced perfusion. Also, when less blood perfuses the kidneys, the kidneys respond by activating the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, which results in water retention and ultimately increases blood pressure, causing hypertension.   Coming off the aorta, you have these smaller arteries called intercostal arteries that run alongside the ribs and supply blood to the area between the ribs, the intercostal space. Keeping aortic coarctation in mind, some of these branch off above the constriction, and they’re called anterior intercostal arteries; they branch from the internal thoracic artery, which is off the subclavian. Some of these branch off below the constriction; these are the posterior intercostal arteries that come directly from the thoracic aorta, and they supply ribs three and below. It turns out that the posterior intercostal arteries serving ribs 1 and 2 actually come off above the constriction as well. Okay, so upstream, you have increased pressure in the aorta, which causes increased pressure in the subclavian, internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal arteries, and the first two posterior intercostal arteries, and then you have decreased pressure in the posterior intercostal arteries for ribs three and below. Now, what you need to know is that these arteries are normally linked up to form an anastomosis, which means that there is a direct connection between these anterior and posterior arteries. Under normal circumstances, pressure is equal in the anterior and posterior arteries so that blood flows away from the heart, as expected.   But now that we have high pressures in these anterior arteries, and low pressures in the posterior arteries for three and below, you actually get reversed flow in the posterior intercostals.   These posterior intercostal arteries dilate to accommodate the high pressure, and when the heart beats, they pulsate and literally rub up against the ribs, slowly wearing away bone. This can be seen on x-ray as “rib notching,” which typically only affects ribs 3-9, but particularly affects ribs 3 and 4. Also, because there is high pressure in both the anterior and posterior intercostal arteries for ribs 1 and 2, there is no reversal of blood flow, so you don’t typically see rib notching there.  All right, so there are a couple of treatment options for adult aortic coarctation, which include:  balloon dilation, where a tiny balloon is used to widen the aorta; and having the narrowed area of the aorta surgically removed, which can correct the hypertension.\n",
            "With thrombophlebitis, thrombo-, or thrombus, refers to a blood clot,  phleb- refers to a vein, and -itis refers to inflammation. So, thrombophlebitis is a blood clot that gets lodged in a vein and causes inflammation.Normally, the process starts with damage to the endothelium, or the inner lining of a blood vessel’s walls. After this, there’s an immediate vasoconstriction, or narrowing of the blood vessel, which limits blood flow. After that, some platelets adhere to the damaged vessel wall and become activated by collagen and tissue factor, which are proteins that are normally kept separated from the blood by an intact endothelium. These platelets then recruit additional platelets to form a plug. The formation of the platelet plug is called primary hemostasis. Next, the coagulation cascade is activated. In the blood, there’s a set of clotting factors, most of which are proteins synthesized by the liver; usually, these are inactive and just floating around in the blood. The coagulation cascade starts when one of these proteins is proteolytically cleaved. This active protein then proteolytically cleaves and activates the next clotting factor, and so on. The final step in the coagulation cascade is the activation of the protein fibrinogen to fibrin, which then deposits and polymerizes to form a mesh around the platelets. All of these steps leading up to fibrin reinforcement of the platelet plug make up the process called secondary hemostasis, and they result in a hard clot at the site of the injury. This cascade has a huge degree of amplification and takes only a few minutes to progress from injury to clot formation. The activation of the cascade is carefully controlled by anticoagulation proteins that target and inactivate key clotting factors. For example, antithrombin inactivates Factors IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa, VIIa and thrombin, while protein C inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa.As the clot grows in size, it limits the amount of blood able to pass through the vein, and pressure in the vein increases. Usually, the clot might start naturally breaking down. For example, enzymes like plasmin break down fibrin into fragments called D-dimers. There are three main factors that lead to thrombosis, and these are referred to as Virchow’s triad. The first factor is slowed blood flow, called stasis, in the veins. Typically, blood continuously flows smoothly through the blood vessel, but if the blood flow becomes turbulent, the linear flow is disrupted and slow or static pockets of blood are formed. Stasis can also happen during long periods of inactivity of the skeletal muscle pump, like bed rest or long flights and car rides. Stasis can even happen during pregnancy, when a growing baby compresses nearby veins. During stasis, platelets and other clotting factors contact the endothelium, and prolonged interaction leads to clotting factor adhesion, and, ultimately, activation of the clotting cascade. The second factor is a state of hypercoagulation, where altered amounts of clotting factors increase either primary or secondary hemostasis. This can happen for genetic reasons or acquired ones, like surgery or taking certain medications, including birth control pills. During surgery, physical damage to vessels activates the clotting cascade. Birth control pills can tip the balance towards clotting because they increase levels of clotting factors and decrease the levels of some anti-coagulation factors, like protein C and antithrombin. The third factor in Virchow’s triad is damage to the endothelial cell lining of a blood vessel that exposes tissue factor and collagen. Damage can be caused by infections, chronic inflammation, or toxins, like those found in tobacco cigarettes. 010.png Thrombophlebitis most often occurs in superficial leg veins, where it’s called superficial thrombophlebitis, and deep leg veins, where it’s called deep venous thrombosis, or DVT. That being said, it can also develop in other areas of the body, like at the site of an IV insertion, especially if an IV has been sitting in the vein for days to weeks. Other conditions that can increase the risk of thrombophlebitis are Trousseau syndrome, where some people with pancreatic cancer get thrombophlebitis in various veins, as well as Mondor disease, where thrombophlebitis occurs in the breast or front chest wall. Sometimes, thrombophlebitis can become infected; an infection in the skin or soft tissue could also cause thrombophlebitis. A classic cause of thrombophlebitis is Staphylococcus aureus, and when the blood clot is infected, it’s called septic thrombophlebitis. As you might guess, having an infected blood clot can be quite dangerous because this can lead to sepsis, and it can quickly allow that infection to be carried by the blood to other parts of the circulatory system.Thrombophlebitis is most common in limbs, and it usually occurs in the lower leg. It can make the area around the clot inflamed, and this causes pain, swelling, redness, and warmth. Superficial thrombophlebitis can cause the affected vein to become hard, like an electrical cord. Septic thrombophlebitis can also cause systemic symptoms, like fevers. If the septic thrombophlebitis is severe enough, it can lead to shock, where there’s a drop in blood pressure and organs can fail from not getting enough blood.Thrombophlebitis can be diagnosed by ultrasound. Alternatively, if the ultrasound is inconclusive, a more invasive venography procedure can be performed. This is when a dye is injected into the veins and an X-ray is taken to identify blockages. Also, a D-dimer blood test can be helpful, because fibrin break-down product levels are usually higher in the presence of a clot.Generally speaking, the body makes and breaks blood clots all the time, and some small clots resolve on their own over time. However, large clots that cause symptoms typically need an intervention. Thrombolytic enzymes can be given to help break down the clot, or a thrombectomy can be done to surgically remove the clot. Long-term treatment to prevent future thrombi from forming can include anticoagulant medications like warfarin or heparin, which inhibit the clotting cascade and prevent clot formation. Prevention of a deep vein thrombosis is also important. Compression stockings and frequent calf exercises during long periods of sitting still can help move blood through the veins to prevent stasis.\n",
            "“Deep vein” refers to the veins that typically run between muscles as they travel back towards the heart, as opposed to superficial veins that you can see on the surface, and “thrombosis” refers to a blood clot. So a deep vein thrombosis or DVT is a blood clot in one of those deep veins.  Normally, blood makes it back to the heart from the tissues and organs via a network of veins that merge over and over. Superficial veins drain blood into deep veins, which rely on the skeletal muscle pump to move blood forward. The way it works is that the surrounding skeletal muscles compress the vein and propel blood forward, and the veins prevent blood from moving backwards by using one-way valves. Ultimately, all of the blood ends up in the superior or inferior vena cava and then dumps into the right atrium. From there, the blood goes into the right ventricle and before being pumped into the pulmonary artery and eventually into the lungs. Deep vein thrombosis most commonly develops in the lower legs, below the knee, although blood clots can form in both superficial and deep veins and in other parts of the body as well. Normally, the process starts with damage to the endothelium or inner lining of blood vessel walls, after which there’s an immediate vasoconstriction or narrowing of the blood vessel, limiting the amount of blood flow. After that, some platelets adhere to the damaged vessel wall, and become activated by collagen and tissue factor, proteins that are normally kept separate from the blood by the intact endothelium. These platelets then recruit additional platelets, forming a plug. The formation of the platelet plug is called primary hemostasis. After that, the coagulation cascade is activated. First off in the blood there’s a set of clotting factors, most of which are proteins synthesized by the liver; usually these are inactive and just float around in the blood. The coagulation cascade starts when one of these proteins gets proteolytically cleaved. This active protein begins a chain reaction, proteolytically cleaving and activates the next clotting factor, and so on. The final step is activation of the protein fibrinogen to fibrin, which deposits and polymerizes to form a mesh around the platelets. These steps leading up to fibrin reinforcement of the platelet plug make up the process called secondary hemostasis; this results in a hard clot at the site of the injury. The cascade has a huge degree of amplification, taking only a few minutes from injury to clot formation. The activation of the cascade is carefully controlled by anticoagulation proteins that target and inactivate key clotting factors. For example, antithrombin inactivates Factors IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa, VIIa and thrombin, while protein S inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa. As the clot grows in size, it limits the amount of blood able to pass through, increasing the pressure in that vein. In most cases, the clot starts naturally breaking down: for example, enzymes like plasmin break down fibrin into fragments called D-dimers. Sometimes, increased pressure in the vein can cause a part of the main clot to break free. This floating clot is called an embolism which can travel downstream towards the heart. When that happens, a thromboembolism—a blood clot on the move—can move from the spot of clot formation and get into the right atrium, then into the right ventricle, before being pumped into the lungs where it can get lodged somewhere, causing a pulmonary embolism. This is a life-threatening situation because it literally blocks blood from getting into the lungs to pick up oxygen. Now, sometimes, individuals might have an atrial septal defect, a small opening between the right and left atrium. In these individuals, it’s possible for a blood clot to go from the right atrium to the left atrium, bypassing the lungs completely. Unfortunately, the clot going into the left ventricle and can sometimes get pumped out to the body, often heading towards the brain and cutting off a blood vessel serving the brain, causing an embolic stroke. There are three main factors that lead to a deep vein thrombosis, which are collectively referred to as Virchow’s triad. The first factor is slowed blood flow, called stasis, in the veins. Typically, blood flows in a continuous, smooth stream through the blood vessels. If the blood flow becomes turbulent, the linear flow is disrupted and slow or static pockets of blood are formed. Stasis can also occur during long periods of inactivity of the skeletal muscle pump, such as with bed rest, long flights and car rides, or even during pregnancy when a growing baby compresses nearby veins. During stasis, platelets and other clotting factors make contact with the endothelium, and their prolonged interaction leads to clotting factor adhesion, and, ultimately, activation of the clotting cascade. The second factor is a state of hypercoagulation, where altered amounts of clotting factors increase primary or secondary hemostasis. This can occur for genetic reasons, acquired reasons like surgery, or simply for taking certain medications like birth control pills. During surgery, physical damage to vessels activates the clotting cascade. Birth control pills tip the blood’s balance towards clotting because they increase the levels of clotting factors and decrease the levels of some anticoagulation factors like protein S and antithrombin. A third factor is damage to the endothelial cell lining of a blood vessel that exposes tissue factor and collagen. Damage can be caused by infections, chronic inflammation or toxins like those found in tobacco cigarettes. A deep vein thrombosis is most common in a limb—usually the lower leg, below the knee—and it can make the area around the clot inflamed, causing pain, swelling, redness, and warmth. If a pulmonary embolism occurs, it can cause sudden shortness of breath and chest pain, and depending on the amount of lung tissue affected, it can even be fatal.Diagnosis of a deep vein thrombosis can be made by ultrasound. Alternatively, if the ultrasound is inconclusive, a more invasive venography procedure can be performed. This is when a dye is injected into the veins and an X-ray is taken to identify blockages. Also, a D-dimer blood test can be helpful, because fibrin breakdown product levels are usually higher in the presence of a clot.Generally speaking, the body makes and breaks blood clots all the time, and some small clots resolve on their own over time, but large clots that cause symptoms typically require some sort of intervention. Thrombolytic enzymes can be given to help break down the clot, or a thrombectomy can be performed to surgically remove the clot. Long-term treatment to prevent future thrombi from forming can include the use of anticoagulant medications like warfarin or heparin, which inhibit the clotting cascade and prevent clot formation. Also, a filter can be surgically placed in the inferior vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolisms.Prevention of a deep vein thrombosis is also important. Compression stockings and frequent calf exercises during long periods of immobilization can help move blood through the veins to prevent stasis.\n",
            "Lymph is the fluid circulating in the lymphatic system, and edema refers to fluid buildup in the body’s tissues; therefore, lymphedema is a buildup of lymph somewhere in the body’s tissues.Typically, this happens as a result of some obstruction in the lymphatic system.All right, let’s back up and briefly talk about this lymph stuff. Oxygenated blood gets sent from the heart to your tissues via arteries, which get smaller and smaller until they feed the capillary beds. The capillary beds then provide nutrients to your cells and pick up waste. Now, deoxygenated blood then feeds back into larger and larger veins, and goes back to the heart. Pressure on the arterial side is a lot higher than on the venous side, so as blood comes into the capillary bed from the smaller arteries, called arterioles, the plasma — the colorless, fluid part of blood — is literally forced out into the interstitial space, or the space between cells. The majority of that fluid is reabsorbed on the venous side, but typically there’s more forced into the tissue through the arterial side than is taken out by the venous side.  Here’s where the lymphatic system comes into play. All of that excess fluid gets pulled into the afferent lymphatic capillaries, which are closed-ended vessels found throughout the body, including, scientists discovered in 2015,  in the brain. These lymphatic capillaries have larger openings than the venous capillaries, which means that in addition to the interstitial fluid, they can accept larger proteins, cellular debris, and even bacteria, which get squeezed out of the arterial side, but are too large to get back into the venous capillaries. Once all of that stuff is in the lymphatic system, it’s called lymph. Also, those afferent lymphatic vessels have one-way valves that, along with smooth muscle contraction, keep the lymph moving along toward the lymph nodes, which have immune cells that once again help filter the fluid, getting rid of potential microbial threats. The fluid then leaves the lymph nodes and drains back into the systemic veins via the thoracic duct, or left thoracic duct, which empties into the left subclavian and jugular veins, and right thoracic duct, which empties into the right subclavian and internal jugular veins, to rejoin the blood once again.  So, let’s get back to lymphedema. When something blocks the normal flow in the lymphatic system, the lymph gets backed up, which means the interstitial fluid can’t drain properly, causing fluid to accumulate in the interstitial space. This means that those proteins and cellular debris build up too, right? When all that stuff stagnates, it initiates an inflammatory reaction that causes macrophages to release inflammatory molecules, which ultimately damage surrounding cells. This leads to fibrosis, which is the thickening of connective tissue, or the creation of scar tissue. Fibrosis causes hardening of the affected area, which is commonly in the limbs.  One of the most common global causes of lymphedema is filariasis, an infection with nematode parasites, which are tiny worms; the most common species are: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Filariasis happens when one of these nematodes gets in the lymphatic system and causes a bit of fibrosis, which creates a physical blockage that obstructs the normal flow of lymph. In developed nations, lymphedema is most commonly caused by cancer malignancy and/or its treatment.   Cancer-associated causes causes of lymphedema include: the lymphatic system itself develops a cancer that causes an obstruction, which is called a primary lymphoma; it could be a result of metastatic tumor cells from somewhere else that travel to the lymphatic system and cause an obstruction; or, it could be the result of cancer treatment, such as if an affected lymph node or group of nodes are removed via surgery. The most common cancer-associated cause of lymphedema is removal of the lymph nodes as a treatment for breast cancer. You’ll notice that all of these causes of lymphedema are the result of some other disease, so these are situations that represent secondary lymphedema.  Primary lymphedema, on the other hand, is when there isn’t some other disease or factor that leads to lymphatic obstruction. Usually, primary lymphedema is a congenital condition that’s been present since birth, possibly as a result of part of the lymphatic system not developing correctly. For this reason, most people develop lymphedema praecox, which is primary lymphedema developed before age 35. When someone develops primary lymphedema later on in life, usually after age 35, it’s called lymphedema tarda. Primary lymphedema is sometimes associated with other genetic disorders as well, such as Turner syndrome.  Early diagnosis of lymphedema is difficult because there aren’t many obvious signs, and it can sometimes mimic chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, which is when blood collects in the veins. However, usually CVI happens bilaterally, meaning on both sides of the body, as opposed to one side, as with lymphedema. Therefore, sometimes lymphedema can be diagnosed by comparing the affected limb to the unaffected limb.   To help with diagnosis, staging systems are often used; the most commonly used system is defined by the World Health Organization. During stage zero, the latent stage, there’s some damage to the lymphatics, but enough lymph is still being removed; thus, lymphedema is not present. During stage one, the spontaneously reversible phase, the tissue is in the pitting stage, where tissue indents when pressed and reverses when it’s elevated; usually, the affected area is normal or almost normal size in the morning.   In stage two, the spontaneously irreversible stage, the tissue takes on a spongy consistency, and is non-pitting; instead, it bounces back when pressed. Also, during stage two fibrosis starts to develop, and the limbs harden and increase in size. Finally, during stage three, lymphostatic elephantiasis, swelling becomes irreversible, and the affected limbs are really large and hardened from fibrosis.  Treatment depends on how severe the edema is, and how far along the fibrosis is in the affected limb. People might wear compressive bandages that can help keep fluid from accumulating, and compression lymphatic massages can help with lymph flow. If these options don’t work, sometimes people with lymphedema can have surgery to help either improve drainage or reduce fluid load.\n",
            "So, when we talk about ischemia, we’re usually talking about this lack of blood flow to a specific area of tissue. For example, with a heart attack, a coronary artery in the heart that supplies the left ventricle with blood gets blocked, so that localized area of heart tissue doesn’t get enough blood and oxygen; that damage is localized to that left ventricle. Shock is like ischemia, but on a global scale. In other words, it’s a circulatory failure of the whole body; blood flow to tissues is dangerously low, which leads to cellular injury, possibly damages multiple organs, and can even lead to multiple organ failure if not treated immediately. Okay, so with shock, the body’s tissues aren’t getting enough oxygen via the blood, right? Normally, blood perfuses through tissue and delivers oxygen because there’s enough pressure in the circulatory system to push it through; so, blood pressure majorly affects the amount of blood perfusing through tissues. Now, blood pressure is determined by two components: the resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels, which is affected by things like vessel length, blood viscosity, and vessel diameter; and the cardiac output, which is the volume of blood pumped by the heart through the body per minute. You can break that down into heart rate, or the number of beats per minute, multiplied by stroke volume, or the amount pumped out each beat. The stroke volume is found by taking the total volume of blood left over after contraction, which is called the end-systolic volume, and subtracting it from the total volume in the heart after filling, or the end-diastolic volume.All right, keeping all this in mind, shock can be caused by many different things, but we can categorize the different types of shock into the three main categories with some subcategories. The first category is called hypovolemic shock. Hypo means “low,” vol refers to “volume,” and emia refers to the blood; thus, hypovolemic shock is shock induced by a low fluid volume of blood. This could be either non-hemorrhagic or haemorrhagic. Non-hemorrhagic means that the loss of fluid volume isn’t from bleeding. For example, if you were stranded in a desert and suffered severe dehydration, eventually your loss of fluid from sweating would reduce blood volume to the point that it wouldn’t be enough to supply your body’s organs, and you’d develop hypovolemic shock. Hecommorrhagic hypovolemic shock, on the other hand, is loss of blood volume through ruptured blood vessels; in other words, it’s loss of blood volume from bleeding. A loss of about 20% of your total blood volume, which is roughly one liter, can be enough to induce hypovolemic shock. When that liter of blood leaves circulation, the total volume filling into the heart goes down; this means that the end-diastolic volume goes down, which causes stroke volume to go down as well. Therefore, cardiac output goes down, and finally we see blood pressure go down. When cardiac output goes down, catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, ADH, and angiotensin II are released. These all cause vasoconstriction of blood vessels, which increases vascular resistance and heart rate, and in turn, this increases cardiac output. These combined effects increase blood pressure. A super important indicator that tissues  are not getting enough oxygen due to hypovolemia is a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation, or MVO2. MVO2 is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the blood coming to the right side of the heart from the tissues. It’s like the amount of oxygen left over, or not extracted and used by the tissues. So, if blood volume is down, it means that oxygen is down, and there’s going to be less left over, right? So MVO2 will be down with hypovolemic shock. Because blood flow also provides heat to the tissues, when it’s down, the skin starts to feel cool and clammy; thus, hypovolemic shock is considered a cold shock. A second main category of shock is cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic means produced by the heart, right? So, this is when something happens to the heart that prevents it from pumping enough blood to the body’s tissues. The most common cause is acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Hold on a second! Didn’t we say at the beginning that a heart attack was more like localized ischemia? Well, the heart attack itself reflects ischemia, but the effects of the initial cardiac damage eventually lead to a state of shock. When the heart’s muscle cells die, it can’t contract as hard, which means the amount of blood pumped out, or stroke volume, goes down; therefore, cardiac output goes down as well. In the same way as with hypovolemic shock, the body releases vasoconstrictors to increase vascular resistance and help maintain blood pressure. Also, similar to hypovolemic shock, in cardiogenic shock MVO2 will be down because since there’s less oxygen being pumped out, less will be left over. Sometimes, there might be an obstruction that doesn’t allow the heart to fill properly with blood. For example, we might have the pericardial sac fill up with fluid from an infection or with blood from trauma, like getting stabbed in the chest. If this sac fills up, it physically constricts and prevents the heart from expanding and contracting normally, reducing the stroke volume. This is sometimes “sub” classified as obstructive shock, but you can see that the cause is still due to the heart’s inability to do its job, right? As in hypovolemic shock, a reduction in cardiac output leads to lowered blood flow, so the skin gets cool and clammy; therefore, cardiogenic shock is also considered a kind of cold shock.   All right, the third main category of shock is called distributive shock. In this category, there’s typically “leakiness” of blood vessels and an excessive amount of arteriole vasodilation, or widening of the peripheral blood vessels. Remember, this widening is one of the components of vascular resistance? If arterioles dilate, vascular resistance to blood flow goes down, and so blood pressure goes down, which leads to less perfusion and distribution of blood to organs and tissues. Now, the most common type of distributive shock is septic shock, which is from pathogens in the blood, and most commonly, gram-negative pathogens. Here’s what happens with septic shock: endotoxins, these large clunky lipopolysaccharide molecules, or LPS, found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria cause a crazy cascade of events that ultimately lead to lowered perfusion. First, these guys directly damage endothelial cells and cause them to release vasodilators, such as nitric oxide. They also activate the complement pathway in the blood, which stimulates mass cell release of histamine, another vasodilator. The LPS molecules also activate immune cells, like macrophages and neutrophils, which help create a bunch of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1. These help the immune system destroy the invaders, but they also stimulate the endothelial cells to release more inflammatory molecules, like platelet activating factor and reactive oxygen species. All of these inflammatory chemicals damage the endothelial cells and increases their vascular permeability, making the blood vessels “leaky.” Endothelial cells also express a procoagulant called tissue factor. Procoagulants are molecules that increase blood coagulation, or blood clotting. These procoagulants combine with an overall decrease in anti-coagulants, which decrease clotting and seem to be often depleted or used up during sepsis, to create a net increase in coagulation and clotting in the microvasculature. Of course, clotting and blockages in the blood vessels further decreases perfusion, right? Okay, so this widespread vasodilation means very little vascular resistance. Blood can’t get the chance to unload as much oxygen as it cruises through the vasculature, and it gets back to the right side of the heart with leftover oxygen. Thus, in this case, in contrast to cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock, MVO2 can be normal or even increased. Also contrary to hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, there’s an increase in flow in the peripheral blood vessels, so the skin becomes warm and flushed; therefore, distributive shock is a kind of warm shock.The combined effects of widespread vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and microvascular blood clotting contribute to decreased perfusion of blood to vital organs. Now, two subcategories of distributive shock are: anaphylactic shock, which is an allergic reaction that causes dangerously low blood pressure; and neurogenic shock, which is when the nervous system gets damaged and can’t control the body’s blood pressure. The treatment of shock depends on the cause. In general, the goal is to stabilize blood pressure so that vital organs like the heart and the brain are perfused with blood. In order to stabilize blood pressure, fluid replacement and medications that increase heart contractility, cause vasoconstriction, and retain fluid can be administered. Oftentimes a person might need supplemental oxygen or have their airway protected, for example with intubation.\n",
            "In angiosarcoma, -sarcoma refers to a malignant tumor, and angio- refers to a blood vessel or a lymphatic vessel. So angiosarcoma is a cancer of either a blood vessel, in which case it’s called a hemangiosarcoma, or a cancer of a lymphatic vessel, in which case it’s called a lymphangiosarcoma. Both arise from the inner lining of the vessel wall, known as endothelium. Angiosarcomas form when endothelial cells suddenly start proliferating abnormally. If these masses grow inside the blood vessel lumen, they can obstruct the blood flow, and that interferes with the oxygen and nutrient supply to various tissues, and can eventually result in tissue ischemia. If lymph flow is obstructed, lymph fluid backs up in the tissues, causing lymphedema. Cancer cells from hemangiosarcomas and lymphangiosarcomas can also invade the vessel wall, destroying it and making it burst, leading to bleeding or lymph fluid outflow in the surrounding tissue. In general, these cancer cells multiply rapidly and can be easily carried by blood flow or lymphatic flow to far-off sites within the body, particularly the lungs, where they form a new, metastatic tumor or tumors. Because of this, angiosarcoma is considered to be a particularly aggressive type of cancer. Angiosarcomas can occur anywhere in the body, but most often develop within the skin, bone, soft tissue, breast, or liver, and often spread from those locations to the lungs. Angiosarcoma of the skin usually shows up on the head or neck as a raised, purplish skin area that looks like a bruise that doesn’t heal; it may bleed, be painful, or be accompanied by swelling of the skin surrounding the affected area. Angiosarcoma of the bone is usually multifocal, meaning it affects multiple sites within the same bone, or involves multiple bones of the same limb. The exact causes of angiosarcoma remain unknown. One risk factor is chronic lymphedema in some part of the body, like the arms or legs, that goes on for several years. This  typically occurs when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged, and the fluid in the tissues has no way of draining away. Lymph nodes are sometimes surgically removed as part of cancer treatment, or destroyed by trauma infection, or they might not even have been present any point due to a congenital problem. Angiosarcomas in the liver have been associated with vinyl chloride gas, a by-product of PVC manufacturing that’s also found in arsenic insecticide.Symptoms of angiosarcoma depend on the affected organ. Soft tissue angiosarcomas can cause pain and swelling, and can compress peripheral nerves which causes sensations of tingling, pricking or numbness. In the breast, angiosarcomas form rapidly-growing, palpable masses, while in the liver, hepatic angiosarcomas can cause vague symptoms like fatigue and abdominal pain. Metastasis of angiosarcoma to the lungs can cause chest pain and lead to difficulty breathing. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma is based on a biopsy of the mass. Imaging studies like an MRI or CT can help establish the location and extension of the cancer. Treatment of angiosarcoma depends on the location and extent of the tumor, and can include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, or a combination of these three.\n",
            "The truncus arteriosus is a big structure that’s present during fetal development; later in development, it divides to form two separate arteries: the aorta and pulmonary artery. Once it’s fully developed, the aorta comes from the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery comes from the right ventricle.   A persistent truncus arteriosus describes when this developmental structure doesn’t divide into the two separate arteries. Instead, the baby’s left with one giant artery that branches off from both the right and the left ventricles that then splits off into the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Sometimes, this condition is simply referred to as truncus arteriosus, or TA. The cause of TA is unknown; however, a lot of cases seem to be associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge Syndrome.  Let’s switch to a more simplified view of the heart. All right, so usually deoxygenated blood comes in from the body and travels to the right atrium; then, it goes to the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs to be re-oxygenated. Next, freshly oxygenated blood passes from the lungs to the left atrium, goes to the left ventricle, and gets pumped through the aorta to the body. Then that circuit repeats, right?  If these two great arteries, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, don’t divide, you essentially have this massive artery coming from both ventricles. However, notice that this one big artery does eventually split into the aorta and pulmonary artery. Even though they eventually split off, before they do, it’s just one single vessel; thus, the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix. When deoxygenated blood mixes into the systemic circulation, it’ll often present as cyanosis, a bluish-purple discoloration of the skin, which can be seen in a baby within the first days after birth.Before birth though, things actually work a little differently. Deoxygenated blood gets sent to the mother, and then oxygenated blood comes from the mother; because the fetus is not using their lungs yet, the fetal heart uses a few tricks, such as sending blood through the foramen ovale. What’s important about this is that because the fetus doesn’t use their lungs yet, there’s relatively high vascular resistance, and therefore high pressure in the pulmonary circulation. So, even though there’s this huge main blood vessel mixing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, the fetus actually does pretty well because the pressures in the two circuits are relatively similar; this similarity means that both circulations get about the same amount of blood.   After the baby’s born, the mother obviously stops supplying blood, the foramen ovale typically closes, and the baby starts to rely on their own lungs. All of this leads to a decrease in vascular resistance and pressure in the pulmonary circuit, which is actually normal. This being said, now there’s a pressure differential between the left and right side, where the left side is higher than the right side, which is also normal. What’s not normal though, is that with TA, the blood’s still able to mix. So, what ends up happening is that since the pressure’s lower in the pulmonary circuit to the lungs, blood tends to shunt toward the lungs, so more blood volume goes to the lungs and less goes to the body. This extra blood volume on the right side leads to fluid overload; with all this extra volume, the heart begins to fail. Therefore, babies with TA quickly develop heart failure, potentially within weeks after birth. Due to the severity of complications with TA, newborn babies require surgical repair. The main goal is to restore normal blood flow through the heart.\n",
            "Normally, the heart is set up so that the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood out to the body through the aorta; deoxygenated blood comes back to the right atrium, flows into the right ventricle, and is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. From the pulmonary artery, it comes back to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and the whole process restarts. The “great arteries,” are the two main arteries taking blood away from the heart: the aorta and pulmonary artery. “Transposing” means that two things switch places with each other. So, transposition of the great arteries, or TGA, is when these two arteries swap locations.   Normally, blood flows through all of these chambers and blood vessels in a big circuit, but if you switch these two main arteries, you switch from one big circuit to two smaller circuits. On the left side, blood is now pumped from the left ventricle, to the pulmonary artery, and to the lungs; it then comes back to the left atrium and left ventricle, and restarts the circuit. On the right side, blood is pumped out of the right ventricle through the aorta, and then goes to the body; blood comes back the the right atrium and right ventricle, and restarts the circuit. Blood on the right side therefore never gets oxygenated, and blood on the left side never gets deoxygenated. This isn’t good. This situation is actually called complete TGA, or sometimes dextro-TGA or d-TGA; dextro means “right,” because, in this case, the aorta is in front of and primarily to the right of the pulmonary artery.  All right, when the fetus in still in the mother’s uterus, babies with d-TGA don’t have any symptoms because they aren’t using their lungs yet. Instead, they rely on blood from the mother and a few shunts for blood flow, including: the foramen ovale, a gap between the atria; the ductus arteriosus, a vessel connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery; and the ductus venosus, a vessel connecting the umbilical cord to the inferior vena cava.   However, after birth, when the baby has to use its lungs for oxygen, these shunts normally go away, the foramen ovale closes, and the vessels become ligaments. This essentially means that d-TGA leads to death, unless there is some way for blood between the pulmonary and systemic circulations to mix. Some possibilities of this happening are if the foramen ovale or ductus arteriosus stay open, or if the baby has a ventricular septal defect, which happens when there’s a shunt between the ventricles — this is actually present in about a third of cases. Any of these possibilities allow the two independent circuits to mix blood and deliver some oxygenated blood to the tissues.   This being said, this system still isn’t very efficient, and a significant amount of deoxygenated blood gets sent to the body’s tissues, which causes cyanosis, a bluish-purple discoloration of the mouth, lips, fingertips, and toes — all areas furthest away from the heart. Sometimes, babies might be given prostaglandin E, which keeps the ductus arteriosus open; however, this is typically only a short-term solution, and ultimately the baby’s going to need surgical repair.   If the shunt is large enough, the initial symptoms might not be noticed, and if the TGA isn’t repaired, the heart can progress to congestive heart failure. This is because the roles of the ventricles have been switched, right? In other words, the right ventricle now pumps out to the higher-pressure systemic circuit, even though it’s built for low-pressure systems, and the left ventricle pumps out to the lower pressure pulmonary circuit, even though it’s built for high pressure systems. So, in response, the right ventricle can hypertrophy, or get larger, and the left ventricle might atrophy, or get smaller; these massive changes in heart structure can ultimately cause the heart to fail.  Less commonly, babies can have levo-transposition of the great arteries, or l-TGA. Levo means that the aorta is primarily to the “left” of the pulmonary artery. In this form, the great arteries are still connected to the wrong ventricle, but the ventricles also switch places along with their atrioventricular valves. In this case, unlike d-TGA, circulation is preserved; therefore, sometimes this is called congenitally corrected TGA. This type is acyanotic, or “not-blue.” For this reason, babies with l-TGA usually won’t have any obvious symptoms at birth. Now, if you take a step back and look at this heart, it doesn’t look that different from a normal heart. However, remember that the left ventricle and mitral valve are built to withstand higher pressures, and the right ventricle and tricuspid valve are built for lower pressures. So, if these guys switch roles and now the right ventricle and tricuspid valve see higher pressures than they’re used to, after years pumping against higher pressures, the right ventricle can hypertrophy, grow in size, and stretch out the tricuspid valve; thus, adults with this issue are at greater risk of heart failure.  Ultimately, the cause of TGA is unknown, but there are diseases and behaviors that are associated with greater risk of babies having TGA. Some known risk factors are related to the pregnancy, such as the expecting mother having diabetes or rubella, poor nutrition, alcohol consumption, and being over 40 years old.  Transposition of the great arteries is diagnosed with an echocardiogram.  Infants that exhibit cyanosis after birth are routinely checked for TGA or other heart abnormalities, but those without symptoms might not be diagnosed until they show symptoms of heart failure later in life.\n",
            "If you’ve ever played Tetris, you probably know that you use pieces made of groups of four squares. Tetralogy of Fallot, or TOF, is a congenital heart condition where patients have four heart abnormalities. Here’s a look at the normal heart: the upper chambers, or the left and the right atria; the lower chambers, or the left and the right ventricles; the aorta; and the pulmonary artery. Instead of using this anatomical heart, let’s look at a simplified version.Let’s go through four abnormal findings of TOF, one at a time. The first abnormality is stenosis, or narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract into the pulmonary artery. This could either be narrowing of the valve itself, or narrowing of the infundibulum, which is the area right below the valve. Either way, this makes it harder for deoxygenated blood to get to the pulmonary circulation. In response, the myocardium of the right ventricle hypertrophies, or gets thicker, in order to contract harder and push blood past the stenosis. This is the second feature of TOF.  This causes their heart to look “boot-shaped” on an x-ray. The third feature is that patients have a large ventricular septal defect, which is a gap between the ventricles that allows blood to shunt between them. Now, in a patient with an isolated ventricular septal defect, which is when the patient doesn’t have TOF, oxygenated blood is shunted from the left side to the right side because the pressure on the left is higher than the pressure on the right. For patients with TOF, however, the right ventricular outflow obstruction might block the normal blood flow so much that the pressure in the right ventricle has to be really high to get past it. Well, the high right-sided pressure causes the left side of the heart to become the path of least resistance, and deoxygenated blood shunts from the right side to the left side. The fourth and final feature of TOF is that the aorta overrides the ventricular septal defect. This one is variable; sometimes, the aorta is way over here sitting on top of the septal defect, and sometimes it’s more on the left ventricular side. Either way, if deoxygenated blood is shunted from right to left, it flows over to the left ventricle and immediately out to the body. When you think about it, the critical feature of these four abnormalities is the degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction. With less obstruction, oxygenated blood might be shunted from left to right and get into the pulmonary circulation, where it takes another run through the lungs. With more obstruction, deoxygenated blood is shunted from right to left and enters the systemic circulation; more deoxygenated blood going to the body essentially means less oxygenation of the tissues, right?In fact, shunting can be severe enough to let the oxygen saturation fall below 80%, at which point patients’ skin takes on a bluish or purpish discoloration, called cyanosis. Tetralogy of Fallot is actually the most common cause of cyanotic congenital heart defects, accounting for about 50-70% of them, and for about 10% of all congenital heart defects in general. Now, it’s not quite clear why some babies develop TOF, but it is associated with chromosome 22 deletions and DiGeorge syndrome. Babies with TOF often have cyanosis around their lips and fingernail beds at birth, and can have clubbing of their fingers and toes within a few months. On the other hand, if a baby doesn’t have severe right ventricular outflow obstruction, they might not be cyanotic. Nevertheless, having any decrease in the normal oxygenation of blood can affect the baby in a lot of ways; those born with TOF can have a range of symptoms, including feeding difficulty and failure to gain weight and develop normally.Babies with TOF often experience symptoms and cyanosis in spells that are referred to as “tet spells.” For example, imagine the baby’s cruising around, increasing oxygen demand; their heart will try to pump more blood, leading to a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation, which causes them to be cyanotic. When this happens, they’ll squat down to reduce the cyanosis. Why does this help? Well, squatting down or getting into a knees to chest position slightly kinks the femoral arteries in the legs, which increases vascular resistance in the peripheral arteries; this increases pressure in the systemic circulation, which increases pressure in the left ventricle enough that the pressure in the left side is now greater than the right side. That shunt temporarily reverses, forcing blood to take the path to the lungs to be oxygenated, thus reducing cyanosis. When patients do have a serious hypercyanotic episode or “tet spell,” they can be treated by keeping them calm and giving them oxygen and IV fluids, and providing them with medications that are aimed at improving pulmonary blood flow.  A diagnosis of TOF is usually made with echocardiography, which can even be done prenatally. Most patients with Tetralogy of Fallot will have cardiac repair surgery in the first year of life; in this procedure, the ventricular septal defect is closed with a patch, and the right ventricular outflow tract is enlarged. Fixing these two defects resolves problems caused by the other two defects. When the right ventricle no longer has to work so hard to pump blood to the lungs, it can return to a normal thickness. Fixing the ventricular septal defect means that only oxygen-rich blood will flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta.### SUMMARYAll right, so, as a quick recap… Tetralogy of Fallot, or TOF, is a congenital disorder characterized by four heart abnormalities—stenosis in the right ventricular outflow tract, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and aortic override of septal defect. Together, these can cause cyanosis in the newborn and is diagnosed with echocardiography. TOF can be corrected using cardiac repair surgery in the first year of life.\n",
            "Hypo means “beneath” or “under,” and plasia means “molding” or “formation,” so hypoplastic means “under form” or in this case, “underdeveloped.” Therefore, hypoplastic left heart syndrome means that the left side of the heart doesn’t fully develop. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, or HLHS, is a congenital heart defect that affects the left side of the heart; it specifically affects the left ventricle and ascending aorta. Also, the aortic valve and mitral valve might be either too small to allow enough blood to flow through, or they might be absent altogether, which is called atresia. The exact mechanism that causes HLHS isn’t known, but one popular theory is that there might be some other primary congenital heart defect that reduces the blood flow through the LV and outflow tract during fetal development, so that part of the heart does not grow and develop normally. This said, HLHS is also often associated with other congenital heart defects, and in particular, with an atrial septal defect, which is an opening between the left and right atria. In fact, not only do these babies usually have this defect, they essentially need it to survive after birth. This is in addition to a patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA, a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery, which usually closes within a few days after birth.   Let’s switch to a more simplified version of the heart to see what happens with blood flow. So, right here you have the atrial septal defect connecting the left and right atria, and the ductus arteriosus, which connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery. This is a really underdeveloped left ventricle and a smallish aortic and mitral valve.   All right, so now let’s take out this septal defect and PDA. What happens? Well, deoxygenated blood comes from the body and goes into the right atrium, then goes to the right ventricle, gets pumped to the lungs, and then oxygenated blood comes back to the left atrium. At this point, blood has a super hard time getting to the left ventricle, so the pressure in the left atrium is high. Blood that does manage to get into the left ventricle is very weakly pumped out to the body. This situation obviously isn’t sustainable, right?So, now let’s add in the septal defect and PDA. Oxygenated blood comes into the left atrium, and since the pressure on the left side is so high, it takes the path of least resistance, and goes through the septal defect and mixes with deoxygenated blood in the right atrium. It then goes to the right ventricle and is pumped out the pulmonary artery, where some of it travels back to the left side through the PDA to the aorta, and out to the body. Clearly, this system isn’t the most efficient way to move blood around the heart, right? But it can be enough to keep the baby alive, and sometimes even relatively asymptomatic in the hours immediately after birth. Normally, within the first day after birth, the ductus arteriosus starts clamping shut, and within three weeks it’s completely closed off and turned into the ligamentum arteriosum. As it closes, blood flow gets more and more restricted to the body, causing cyanosis, or bluish purple discoloration of the skin. Eventually, this leads to cardiogenic shock, and without intervention of some kind, HLHS is fatal. HLHS is often diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound, but occasionally isn’t diagnosed until after the baby is born using echocardiography. Prostaglandin is often given to babies to help keep the ductus arteriosus open until a staged surgery can be performed to fix the heart defects. Occasionally, a heart transplant can be done as well, but because of the complexity of HLHS, these treatment decisions are made on a patient-by-patient basis.\n",
            "Patent — not in the sense of a patent for an invention — refers to some opening. A patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA for short, refers to a blood vessel, the ductus arteriosus, which connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta during fetal development. The ductus arteriosus is right on the aortic arch where vessels branch off to the brain and upper extremities. All right, so to help visualize this, let’s look at a super simplified version of the heart to show the relationship between the aorta, branches, pulmonary artery, and ductus arteriosus. We’ll still keep the more anatomical heart for reference. So, the ductus arteriosus usually closes after birth because the walls collapse down; this vessel becomes a ligament, the ligamentum arteriosum. When it stays open after birth, we call it a patent ductus arteriosus because it’s still passing blood through it; in other words, it’s still patent. Now, during development, the fetus doesn’t use the lungs yet; instead, it relies on oxygenated blood from the placenta, which comes into the right atrium. Most of that blood actually flows through the foramen ovale, an opening between the atria. Blood that doesn’t make it through the foramen ovale is pumped out of the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, at which point most of it gets sent through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta instead of to the lungs. Remember, the fetus isn’t using the lungs yet.During fetal development, the ductus arteriosus is kept open by high levels of a vasodilator prostaglandin E2, which is made by the placenta and the ductus arteriosus. At birth, a bunch of things change. First, oxygen levels in the blood go up dramatically and the lungs become the main source of oxygenated blood. Soon after birth, the foramen ovale closes and prostaglandin E2 levels fall, causing the ductus arteriosus to close off. The lungs also start to release a small peptide called bradykinin, which constricts the smooth muscle wall of the ductus arteriosus and sort of helps the process along. Within the first day, the ductus arteriosus usually starts clamping shut; within three weeks, it’s completely closed off and turned into the ligamentum arteriosum. If the ductus arteriosus doesn’t close, then the baby is left with a patent ductus arteriosus. This condition accounts for about 10% of all congenital heart defects, of which the vast majority, about 90%, are isolated heart defects, meaning there aren’t any additional congenital defects. On the other hand, a PDA can be associated with other congenital problems, such as congenital rubella syndrome, which happens when the mother contracts rubella virus during her pregnancy.All right, so now we’ve got this ductus arteriosus still open, and the patient is still using their lungs; what happens now? Well, as blood comes into the right atrium, and then goes to the right ventricle, it approaches the ductus arteriosus and has two options: keep going down the pulmonary artery, or reroute to the higher pressure system in the aorta. Since blood likes to move from high pressure to low pressure, and there’s higher pressure over in the aorta, it actually just keeps going on to the lungs. Next, that freshly oxygenated blood comes over into the left atrium and the left ventricle; now, again it has a choice, but this time it’s already in the higher pressure system, and now some of it is shunted back to the lower pressure in the pulmonary artery. At this point, the shunt is left-to-right, so oxygenated blood flows back and takes a second unnecessary trip to the lungs. What we don’t have is any deoxygenated blood escaping into the systemic circulation, which would cause a baby to appear cyanotic; therefore, we call this acyanotic, which means “not blue”.Usually, this situation is asymptomatic, and patients can have what’s known as a holosystolic “machine-like” murmur from blood moving from the aorta to the pulmonary artery.However, later in life, patients might develop pulmonary hypertension from years of increased pulmonary blood volume, or higher pressures on the pulmonary side. If this happens, pressure might eventually increase to a point where right-sided pressures are greater than left-sided pressures, and thus the flow of blood through the PDA can be reversed. When this changes from a left-to-right shunt to a right-to left shunt, it’s referred to as Eisenmenger’s syndrome. Now, you’ve got deoxygenated blood flowing into the aorta and generally heading to the lower extremities, because the upper extremities and head typically have arterial branches upstream from the PDA. This results in cyanosis in the lower extremities, which is a blue or purple discoloration of the skin that’s the result of deoxygenated blood mixing with oxygenated blood. This situation is sometimes called differential cyanosis because only the lower body is cyanotic. Patent ductus arteriosus can actually be treated early on. Remember how prostaglandin E2 keeps the ductus arteriosus open during fetal development? Well, the drug indomethacin can be used to close a PDA because it’s a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, that inhibits prostaglandin E2. In some cases, the PDA may be closed by surgical ligation as well. ### SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap.... When the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, it’s called patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA. PDA allows some oxygenated blood to return back to the lungs but it doesn’t allow deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation, which means it’s acyanotic.  Initially PDA causes a left-to-right shunt, resulting in pulmonary hypertension. Over time, as the pulmonary artery pressure increases, this is converted into a right-to-left shunt. This switch in the shunt is known as Eisenmenger’s syndrome. PDA can be treated with the drug indomethacin, or by surgical ligation.\n",
            "If you look at the heart, you’ve got the right and left atria up top, and the right and left ventricles down below. Each of these pairs is separated by a wall called the septum. A ventricular septal defect is when the lower wall, the ventricular septum, has a gap in it after development.   The septum is formed during development as a muscular ridge of tissue grows upward from the apex, or the tip, and then fuses with a thinner membranous region coming down from the endocardial cushions. Voila: now there are two separate chambers. However, If these tissues don’t fuse, then a gap is left between the two chambers; this is a ventricular septal defect, or VSD. The majority of cases are caused by a defect in the membranous portion of the septum.  Among babies, VSDs are actually the overall most common congenital defect. However, 30 to 50% of VSDs can spontaneously close during childhood, which makes ventricular defects less common among adults. VSDs are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome and Down syndrome, and are often associated with other cardiac deformities.   All right, so let’s check out what happens with blood flow, now that there’s this opening between the two ventricles. We’ll switch to this super-duper simplified image of the heart, just because it’s easier to show what’s going on with blood flow. So, deoxygenated blood comes from the body to the right atrium, and then flows down into the right ventricle; here, it can now either be pumped out to the lungs as normal, or pop over to the left ventricle. Because the pressure on the left side of the heart is actually higher than on the right, and because blood likes to flow from high pressure to low pressure, it actually prefers to just keep going into the lungs. When oxygenated blood comes back from the lungs and enters the left atrium, and then the left ventricle, again it’s got two choices: it can either be pumped out to the body, or flow over to the right ventricle through the gap. Since now the blood is in the left ventricle, which has higher pressure, some of the blood flows over to the lower pressure right ventricle; thus, now there’s a left-to-right shunt through which oxygenated blood takes an extra trip to the lungs.   Because there’s more oxygenated blood over here, patients will have increased oxygen saturation in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Also, the blood flowing through a VSD can be heard as a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  If it’s a small VSD, it might be asymptomatic. As the size of the VSD increases, however, symptoms tend to get more severe and present earlier in life. What sort of symptoms? Well, as blood is shunted to the right side, blood volume increases on the right side, which might lead patients to develop pulmonary hypertension, or higher pressures on the pulmonary side. If pressure increases to a point where the right side’s more than the left side, then the direction of blood flow through the VSD can switch from being left-to-right to right-to-left; this condition is known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Now, deoxygenated blood is escaping out to the systemic circulation, and being pumped out to the whole body via the aorta. This essentially means that less oxygen is being delivered to the tissues, which definitely isn’t good. Patients can present with cyanosis; specifically, it can appear as bluish skin in certain areas, such as around the lips or the fingertips.   Due to the severity of these complications associated with larger defects, surgical closure of the VSD might be needed.\n",
            "Coarctation is a fancy way of saying “narrowing,” so a coarctation of the aorta means a narrowing of the aorta. If we look at the heart, we’ve got the right and left atria, the right and left ventricles, the pulmonary artery leaving the right ventricle to go to the lungs, and the aorta leaving the left ventricle to go to the body.   There are two forms of aortic coarctation to be familiar with: an “infant” form and an “adult” form. With the infant form, which accounts for about 70% of cases, the coarctation comes after the aortic arch, which branches off to the upper extremities and to the head, and before the ductus arteriosus. Now, you might be thinking, “Hey, what’s this ductus arteriosus thing doing here?” Well, typically this guy only exists during fetal development and closes after birth, but with infantile coarctation, the ductus arteriosus is usually still open, or patent, so there’s a patent ductus arteriosus. In fact, sometimes this form is also called preductal coarctation.  So, if we draw out a more simplified version of the heart, we’ve got deoxygenated blood coming into the right atrium that flows into the right ventricle. Now, as it’s pumped out of the pulmonary artery, it’s got two choices, right? One option is to go through the patent ductus arteriosus and continue down the aorta; the other option is to continue down the way it’s going. Well, since it’s higher pressure over here on the left side, you might think that the blood would say “thanks, but no thanks,” and keep going down the lower pressure pulmonary artery. Instead, this aortic coarctation adds a little twist. Since the spot right before the ductus arteriosus is narrower, blood flowing from the left side has a harder time going through, so actually there’s high pressure upstream of the coarctation, but low pressure downstream. So, what happens is that blood decides to go this way, through the patent ductus arteriosus and into the lower pressure area in the systemic circulation, and then continues down to the lower extremities, rather than the slightly higher pressure pulmonary artery. This gives you a real sense of exactly how much this coarctation reduces the pressure over on the systemic side.   Since deoxygenated blood is going to the lower extremities, infants typically present with lower extremity cyanosis, meaning a bluish or purplish discoloration of the lower limbs, which is often present even at birth. This is a really important thing to catch, because without intervention, these infants often don’t survive past the neonatal period. Infantile coarctation is something that happens during fetal development, and can occur on its own or can be associated with other congenital changes. It’s worth mentioning that it’s highly associated with Turner syndrome, a genetic abnormality where females only have one X chromosome instead of two.All right, this brings us to adult coarctation, which accounts for the other 30% of cases, and typically develops, well, as an adult. Compared to infantile coarctation, in this type there usually isn’t a patent ductus arteriosus; instead, it’s been long since closed off and is now known as the ligamentum arteriosum. The coarctation usually happens in adults just distal to this ligament. So, now there’s no mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, but just like in infantile coarctation, the pressure is increased before the coarctation, because blood has a harder time squeezing through this narrowed artery, and it’s going to be lower downstream from the coarctation.  This causes both upstream and downstream issues. Upstream issues include blood flow increases into the aortic branches, and thus blood pressure increases in the upper extremities and the head. Increased cerebral blood flow means an increased risk of berry aneurysms, which happen when weak spots along blood vessels in the brain balloon out from the high pressures and become tiny sacs filled with blood. This increased pressure also tends to cause the aorta and aortic valve to dilate, or get larger, and the increased pressure means the aorta is at risk of aortic dissection, or tearing of the inner layer of the aorta.   Now, let’s look at downstream issues. Because blood flow downstream from the constriction is decreased, there’ll be decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and patients will have a weak pulse in those lower extremities. Since blood pressure’s lower, patients sometimes experience claudication in their legs, which is pain and cramping due to reduced perfusion. Also, when less blood perfuses the kidneys, the kidneys respond by activating the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, which results in water retention and ultimately increases blood pressure, causing hypertension.   Coming off the aorta, you have these smaller arteries called intercostal arteries that run alongside the ribs and supply blood to the area between the ribs, the intercostal space. Keeping aortic coarctation in mind, some of these branch off above the constriction, and they’re called anterior intercostal arteries; they branch from the internal thoracic artery, which is off the subclavian. Some of these branch off below the constriction; these are the posterior intercostal arteries that come directly from the thoracic aorta, and they supply ribs three and below. It turns out that the posterior intercostal arteries serving ribs 1 and 2 actually come off above the constriction as well. Okay, so upstream, you have increased pressure in the aorta, which causes increased pressure in the subclavian, internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal arteries, and the first two posterior intercostal arteries, and then you have decreased pressure in the posterior intercostal arteries for ribs three and below. Now, what you need to know is that these arteries are normally linked up to form an anastomosis, which means that there is a direct connection between these anterior and posterior arteries. Under normal circumstances, pressure is equal in the anterior and posterior arteries so that blood flows away from the heart, as expected.   But now that we have high pressures in these anterior arteries, and low pressures in the posterior arteries for three and below, you actually get reversed flow in the posterior intercostals.   These posterior intercostal arteries dilate to accommodate the high pressure, and when the heart beats, they pulsate and literally rub up against the ribs, slowly wearing away bone. This can be seen on x-ray as “rib notching,” which typically only affects ribs 3-9, but particularly affects ribs 3 and 4. Also, because there is high pressure in both the anterior and posterior intercostal arteries for ribs 1 and 2, there is no reversal of blood flow, so you don’t typically see rib notching there.  All right, so there are a couple of treatment options for adult aortic coarctation, which include:  balloon dilation, where a tiny balloon is used to widen the aorta; and having the narrowed area of the aorta surgically removed, which can correct the hypertension.\n",
            "The atrial septum separates the right and left atrium of the heart. An atrial septal defect describes when there’s an opening in a baby’s heart between these two upper chambers. But how does this opening form? Well, let’s run through how the septum develops in the first place.When the heart is first developing, a tissue called the septum primum between the left and right atria grows downward, slowly creating two separate chambers by closing this gap, or ostium primum, which means “first opening.” The septum primum then fuses with the endocardial cushion and closes the gap completely. Meanwhile, a hole appears in the upper area, called the ostium secundum, or “second opening.” Now, we also have the septum secundum which grows downward, just to the right of the septum primum, and covers the ostium secundum like a curtain, leaving a small opening called the foramen ovale, thus essentially creating a makeshift valve that allows blood to go from right atrium to left atrium, but not the other way. The developing newborn gets oxygenated blood from the placenta, which goes from the umbilical vein over to the right atrium, which is different because after development, only deoxygenated blood goes to the right atrium, and then gets sent to the lungs to pick up some oxygen. In the developing fetus, though, it’s already oxygenated, so instead of going to the right ventricle and to the lungs and back to the left atrium, it just bypasses the right ventricle and lungs through the foramen ovale and goes into the left atrium. The oxygenated blood then goes to the left ventricle to be pumped to the body.At birth, the septum secundum and septum primum slap shut, and then fuse and close off this foramen ovale so that we can rely on our own lungs for oxygen. An atrial septal defect, or ASD, describes a condition where the septum between the right and left atrium doesn’t close up all the way and remains open even after birth. Most  About 90% of ASD cases are due to the ostium secundum which  can happen when the  secundum septum doesn’t grow enough during development. This actually accounts for about 10-15% of all congenital heart defects and is the most common congenital heart defect in adults. Fewer ASD cases are due to the ostium primum, where the “first opening” doesn’t make it all the way down, again leaving an opening between right and left atria. This primum type of congenital defect is found in around 25% of patients with Down syndrome. In general, atrial septal defects are also commonly associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.Okay, so there’s this opening in the septum; now what? You know how pressure’s higher on the left side than on the right? Well, this pressure difference causes blood to be shunted from the left atrium to the right atrium, meaning more oxygenated blood gets over to the right side, which is usually deoxygenated blood. This type of defect is an acyanotic heart defect, which means “not blue,” because oxygenated blood is going into pulmonary circulation and essentially taking an extra trip to the lungs. In contrast, a cyanotic heart defect allows deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and make it out to the body, causing a blue or purplish discoloration of the skin, which is not the case here. That being the case, you’ll see an increase in oxygen saturation of blood in the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery. This extra blood volume passing by the pulmonic valve also causes a delay in the closure of the pulmonic valve relative to the aortic valve closure. This slight delay can be heard via auscultation as a splitting of the S2 sound, as well as a systolic murmur in some cases.One potential complication for patients with an ASD is if the patient develops an embolus — let’s say a blood clot, because that’s the most common type — that makes its way through the ASD. So, if we take the example of a person with a deep vein thrombosis, part of that blood clot might break loose and become an embolus. Usually, this guy would travel into the right atrium, then right ventricle, and then be pumped off to the lungs and lodge somewhere in the lung. It’s possible that the embolus crosses over to the left side, in which case it can enter the systemic circuit and potentially lodge in the brain. This situation is called paradoxical embolism; it’s paradoxical because the embolus starts off in the right side, but crosses over into the left side.Sometimes, children with ASDs will be monitored for a little while because smaller openings may close on their own. In other cases, especially for larger openings, surgery — which typically involves plugging or patching the opening — will be performed to prevent complications in the future.### SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… An atrial septal defect is a congenital heart defect where the septum between the right and left atrium doesn’t close up all the way and remains open after birth. This causes oxygenated blood to go into pulmonary circulation. One complication from this condition is a paradoxical embolus, which crosses from the right to the left side via the ASD.\n",
            "The heart has four chambers: two upper chambers, the right and left atrium; and two lower chambers, the right and left ventricles. Fibrillation describes when the muscle fibers are all contracting at different times, so the end result is a quivering, or twitching movement.   Normally, an electrical signal is sent out from the sinus node in the right atrium. The signal then propagates out through both atria super fast, which allows them to depolarize at about the same time, so that you end up with a nice, coordinated contraction of the atria. That signal then moves down to the ventricles and causes them to contract shortly after.   With Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib or AF, signals move around the atria in a completely disorganized way that tends to override the sinus node. Instead of one big contraction, you get all these mini contractions that make it look like the atria are just quivering.   On an  electrocardiogram, or ECG, normally the “P wave” corresponds to the atrial contraction. The “QRS complex,” which is the ventricular contraction, follows shortly after. During AF, all these small areas contract at different times so that you end up with an electrocardiogram that looks like scribbles, where each little peak corresponds to one spot in the atria twitching. Sometimes, a signal from one of these areas makes it down to the ventricles and cause ventricular contraction; these QRS complexes are interspersed at irregular intervals though, and usually at fairly high rates between 100 and 175 beats per minute.   In the normal heartbeat, a well-coordinated atrial contraction contributes a small amount of blood that’s called the “atrial kick.” People with AF lose this atrial kick; however, this loss isn’t life-threatening.  Okay, but how or why does this happen in the atrium? Why do the cells start depolarizing in a totally uncoordinated way? Well, the answer isn’t super cut-and-dry. There are a ton of risk factors that predispose someone to developing AF, and the exact mechanisms aren’t well understood. AF often happens alongside other cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, valvular diseases — essentially anything that can create an inflammatory state or physically stretch out the atria and potentially damage the cells in the atria. Other, non-cardiovascular risk factors include: obesity, diabetes, and excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, there also seems to be a genetic component.  These factors likely stress the cells in the atria, which can lead to tissue heterogeneity; or in other words, cells start taking on different electrical properties. For example, one cell might start conducting signals faster than its neighbor, and another cell might develop a shorter refractory period — the time following depolarization during which they can’t conduct another signal. These different tissue properties can ultimately cause the conduction in the atria to become unpredictable.  Normally, with tissue that’s the same, you’ll get essentially one wavefront of conduction that moves through the atria. According to the multiple wavelet theory, with different tissue properties, multiple wavelets develop. These wavelets conduct randomly around the atria, sometimes colliding and creating new “daughter wavelets.”   Along with the multiple wavelet theory, there’s also an automatic focus theory. According to the automatic focus theory, there’s a specific origin that is thought to initiate AF by rapid firing of electrical impulses that overtake the sinus node. Combined with risk factors and tissue heterogeneity, this can promote AF. It’s thought that a focused group of cells conduct cells in the cardiac muscle around pulmonary veins — yeah, pulmonary veins! Remember that these veins physically enter the left atrium, and where the pulmonary veins enter there is tissue that has really unique electrical properties.   Oftentimes, people with AF start by experiencing paroxysmal events, which means AF suddenly comes and goes, lasting less than a week at a time, probably because the tissue is still relatively healthy. Repeated paroxysmal events that occur over longer periods of time tend to stress the atrial cells even more. There are probably a number of mechanisms explaining how a burst of rapid beats from one of these paroxysmal events leads to stress; for example, one of these potential mechanisms is calcium overload.Over time, the cells in the atrium seem to undergo progressive fibrosis or scarring from this stress. When this happens, the AF episode isn’t able to spontaneously terminate, and patients have persistent AF, which is AF that lasts more than a week without self-terminating.Persistent AF episodes can last for quite a long time — weeks to months — and when the AF episodes last beyond 12 months, it’s known as long-standing persistent AF.  When the patient and clinician make a joint decision not to attempt to stop the rhythm it is called “Permanent AF.”  Common symptoms of AF are feelings of general fatigue, because the heart rate isn’t governed by the sinus node anymore, and contracts at irregular intervals, so that blood is delivered less effectively to the tissues. Other related symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath, and weakness. A patient might also feel palpitations or “thumping” in their chest.  One potential complication of AF is stroke. When the atria don’t contract as a single unit, but just sort of quiver, the blood that sits in the atria becomes stagnant. When blood stays still, it tends to form clots. With AF, it’s possible that blood clots form which then travel into the ventricles and are pumped off to the body, and potentially to the brain, where they can lodge. This cuts off blood flow to that part of the brain, which is a type of stroke.  Now, diagnosis of persistent AF is done by electrocardiogram. However, if the episodes are paroxysmal, but suspected, then someone might have a holter monitor, which is a portable device placed on the chest that monitors their rhythm over longer periods of time and records potential AF events to be viewed later.   Since AF is caused by such a diverse range of issues, treatment is generally different from patient to patient. Certain medications that help control the heart rate might be given, or medications that reduce the likelihood of blood clot formation, and therefore prevent stroke. Also, patients might receive an implantable cardiac pacemaker, which by constantly pacing the atrium can reduce the chance of an AF episode. Finally, some patients may have a radiofrequency catheter ablation, where certain areas of tissue are destroyed so that the electrical signal doesn’t propagate any more. One type of procedure is the “maze procedure” where a maze of new pathways are created to help electrical impulses move in a more consistent and predictable pattern.   Sometimes, patients will have the ablation of the AV node, essentially cutting off any communication between the two. Since the ventricles aren’t getting any input anymore though, these patients need an implantable pacemaker to make sure the ventricles contract at high enough rates.\n",
            "The heart has two upper chambers, which are called the atria, and a premature atrial contraction, or PAC, is when the atria contract earlier than normal in the cardiac cycle. So normally, the sinoatrial, or SA, node sends an electrical signal called a depolarization that propagates out through the walls of the heart and causes both upper chambers to contract. Then, that signal moves to the atrioventricular, or AV, node, where it’s delayed for a split second. Then, the signal travels down into the ventricles, or lower chambers, where it moves down the bundle of His into the left and right bundle branches and into each ventricle’s Purkinje fibers, causing them to contract as well. This trip is called a depolarization wave, and in a healthy heart, it makes sure that the upper chambers contract before the lower chambers contract. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which measures the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes that are placed on the skin, the atrial depolarization and its contraction are seen as a P-wave, the ventricular contraction is seen as a QRS complex, and the ventricular repolarization and its relaxation are seen as a T-wave. If an atrial cell outside of the SA node initiates a depolarization, that’s called an atrial ectopic focus. Now, this could be initiated by a cell that’s part of the conduction system, or it could just be initiated by another cardiac muscle cell. This typically happens when atrial cells are irritated and stressed by electrolyte imbalances, drugs like cocaine or methamphetamines, ischemic damage like a heart attack, or anything that increases sympathetic activity, like anxiety. Another type of atrial ectopic focus is a reentrant loop, which is when there’s some tissue that doesn’t depolarize properly, which could happen in scar tissue after a heart attack. As a result of this damage, the depolarization wave ends up circling around and around that tissue. A reentrant loop basically starts sending out depolarization waves to the rest of the heart tissue each time the wave goes around. So, in short, a particularly stressed out atrial cell or a reentrant loop can send out depolarization waves that contract the atria too quickly, and that’s an early, or premature, atrial contraction. One important effect of premature depolarization is that the ectopic focus will depolarize the cells of the SA node, which causes the SA node to skip a cycle. So, let’s say the SA node is working as usual, but, all of a sudden, an ectopic focus fires off a depolarization early. Now, if we measure out the interval between each SA node fire, we see that the SA node should have fired here, but it doesn’t because it was depolarized by the ectopic focus. This means that the SA node essentially skips one cycle of sending its own signal. So, the sinus node waits to fire for the same interval that it normally would, but it also fires based on the ectopic beat. This means that that you end up with an interval with two sinus beats and an ectopic beat in the middle, and that interval is shorter than an interval that’s three sinus beats in a row. This shorter interval is called a noncompensatory pause, where the distance from sinus P-wave to the ectopic P-wave to the next sinus P-wave is less than the distance from the sinus P-wave to sinus P-wave to sinus P-wave.The location of the ectopic focus in the atria determines how the heart contracts and therefore what the ECG looks like.  If the ectopic focus is at the bottom of the atria, then the P-wave will be upside-down. This is because instead of flowing from the top of the atria to the bottom, which is how depolarization normally spreads, the electricity flows in the opposite direction, i.e. from the bottom of the atria to the top.Also, the closer the ectopic focus is to the AV node, the shorter the PR interval, which is the time from the P-wave to the QRS complex, will be. This is because the wave will have a shorter distance to travel. If the heart is beating fast enough, the P-wave from the premature atrial contraction might happen at the same time as the T-wave from the previous, normal contraction. In this case, the two waves will combine, making that T-wave look peaked, which means that it’s just a bit more lumpy than usual, kind of like a camel’s hump.The timing of the PAC will also determine how the heart contracts and therefore what the ECG will look like. When the depolarization wave from an atrial ectopic focus gets to the AV node, there are a few things that could happen. If the AV node is receptive, the signal will be conducted down to the ventricles, resulting in a normal QRS complex. However, if a depolarization wave from an atrial ectopic focus gets through the AV node but is sent through the ventricles abnormally, like when a bundle branch is in refractory, this will lead to an aberrant signal. Most often, the aberrancy is due to a right bundle branch block because that’s the bundle branch that has a longer refractory period. In this situation, the depolarization wave conducts down the left bundle branch and then through the ventricles aberrantly, resulting in an abnormally wide QRS complex. Now, in both of these situations, the QRS complex comes in early, which means we’ve got an early ventricular contraction. So, the heart didn’t have time to fill with as much blood as it normally would, and when it doesn’t fill as much, it doesn’t stretch as much. Therefore, the heart doesn’t pump as strongly as it normally would.Finally, the depolarization from an atrial ectopic focus might reach the AV node while it’s still in refractory, and this means that the signal won’t be conducted at all. In this case, there’s no QRS complex or ventricular contraction. Even here, though, the SA node is reset, and, once again, one cycle later, the SA node will fire a tiny bit early since it’s been reset by the atrial ectopic focus, and that will be followed by a normal looking QRS complex. In this scenario, the ventricles are filling with blood the whole time, and so the ventricle ends up being a bit overfilled and stretches more than it normally would. This results in a really strong contraction, often called a palpitation, that people can often feel.Sometimes, premature atrial contractions can keep happening rather than being isolated events. When a premature atrial contraction consistently occurs after each normal cardiac cycle, it’s called atrial bigeminy. When one consistently occurs after every two normal cardiac cycles, it’s called atrial trigeminy. This so-called “group beating” can be differentiated from a Type 1 second-degree atrioventricular heart block by identifying the abnormally shaped P-waves that characterize an atrial ectopic focus.Most people with premature atrial contractions don’t actually notice any symptoms. If premature atrial contractions keep occurring, though, they can cause lightheadedness because less blood is being delivered to the brain. People might also feel palpitations. In rare situations, an ectopic focus can trigger atrial fibrillation, which is a more serious arrhythmia where the atria essentially just quiver instead of pumping.Premature atrial contractions are diagnosed with an ECG, which will show an early and abnormal looking P-wave and, potentially, an early QRS as well. Sometimes a Holter monitor, which is like a continuous ECG monitor used over a few days, is needed to capture the event.Typically, treatment for premature atrial contractions isn’t required. However, if there’s an obvious cause, like medication or use of a substance, then stopping this will typically resolve the issue. If the premature atrial contractions keep happening or cause palpitations, they can be treated with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, both of which prevent the heart from beating too strongly. If an ectopic focus is triggering atrial fibrillation, radiofrequency ablation can be done, which is where radiofrequency waves are used to destroy the tissue that’s causing the ectopic heartbeat.\n",
            "The atria are the heart’s upper chambers; the ventricles are the lower chambers. Reentrant tachycardias are fast heart rates caused by electrical signals that loop back on themselves.  Normally, an electrical signal starts at the sinoatrial or SA node in the right atrium and propagates out through both atria, including bachmann’s bundle in the left atrium, and then contracts both atria. It’s then delayed just a little bit as it goes through the atrioventricular, or AV node, before it passes through the Bundle of His and on to the Purkinje fibers of the left and right ventricles, causing them to contract as well.Usually, the only place where a signal can go from the atria to the ventricles is at the AV node, and once that signal gets to the purkinje fibers, it stops and the heart tissue waits for another signal from the SA node. With an atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, or AVRT, the electrical signal actually uses a separate accessory pathway to get back up from the ventricles to the atria, which causes the atria to contract before the SA node sends out another signal. The signal then moves back down the AV node to the ventricles and purkinje fibers, contracts the ventricles, and goes back up that accessory pathway. This cycle repeats, which is why AVRT can result in rates as high as 200-300 bpm. This type of tachycardia is known as a supraventricular tachycardia because the signal causing the fast rate originates above the ventricles. The most common type of AVRT is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where the accessory pathway is called the Bundle of Kent. This type of reentry is known as an anatomical reentrant circuit because the accessory pathway is a fixed, anatomically-defined pathway.   Another type of reentrant circuit is atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, or AVNRT. AVNRT, just like AVRT, is a type of supraventricular tachycardia; however, with AVNRT it’s in or near the AV node, which similarly contracts the ventricle and the atria every time it goes around.   Specifically, there are two separate electrical pathways that make up this loop. One of these pathways has heart tissue that has slow electrical conduction; it’s called the alpha pathway. The other has fast conduction; it’s called the beta pathway. Additionally, the alpha pathway has a short refractory period, which is the time it takes to conduct another signal. The beta pathway, on the other hand, has a long refractory period. Once you have all these things, you’ve got yourself a recipe for AVNRT.   So, let’s say a signal comes down from the SA node in the right atrium, the signal goes down the fast pathway, and reaches the other end before the slow pathway. Next, it splits to travel down to the ventricles, as well as up the alpha pathway, where it meets the slow signal and they both cancel each other out.   At this point, both enter into their refractory period. Because the alpha pathway is shorter, it comes out of refractory sooner and is ready for another signal, while the beta pathway’s still in refractory. So, if another signal comes by, it’ll start down the slow pathway, but since the fast is still in refractory, it’ll be blocked.  At some point while the signal’s going down the alpha side, that beta side will come out of refractory, and then it’ll be ready to go. So, now as the signal exits the alpha pathway to the ventricles and enters the refractory period, it also travels up the beta pathway, and by the time it reaches the alpha pathway again, that pathway’s out of refractory!  Now you have a reentrant loop that keeps going and going, and every time around it causes both an atrial and a ventricular contraction, which again just like AVRT, leads to high ventricular rates. This particular setup, where it goes down the slow pathway, or anterograde, and up the fast pathway, or retrograde, is called slow-fast AVNRT, or typical AVNRT.   However, it’s also possible to have the opposite, called fast-slow AVNRT or atypical AVNRT, which, as the name suggests, is a lot less common than slow-fast AVNRT. With this type, the pathway goes down the fast pathway, or anterograde, and up the slow pathway, or retrograde.  The tachycardia with AVRT and AVNRT typically doesn’t last very long, and both are rarely life-threatening. They both can produce symptoms including: palpitations; shortness of breath; feelings of dizziness; and syncope or fainting, in rare cases.  On an ECG, the P wave is the signal from atrial contraction, and the QRS is the signal from ventricular contraction. On an ECG with AVNRT, the P waves might not be visible because the signal gets to the atria and ventricles at almost the same time, so the P wave starts essentially where the QRS starts, and when you add them together, the P wave can get buried under the QRS complex. With AVRT, the P waves may or may not be buried, depending on where the accessory pathway is located.   The definitive treatment for both AVRT and AVNRT is radio catheter ablation. For AVRT, this means destruction of the accessory pathway. For AVNRT,  this means destruction of the slow, or alpha, pathway. Sometimes for AVNRT, people can use vagal maneuvers to activate the vagus nerve, which tends to block the AV node temporarily, therefore potentially stopping the episode. Some methods to do this include a carotid sinus massage and a valsalva maneuver, which is forced exhalation against a closed airway. Also, they may use medications to slow AV node conduction. In rare cases, when other treatments haven’t been effective, they might need cardioversion.\n",
            "Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or WPW, is a type of heart arrhythmia caused by an accessory pathway, or an extra electrical conduction pathway, connecting the atria and ventricles, or the upper and lower chambers of the heart.Normally, an electrical signal starts at the sinoatrial node, or SA node, in the right atrium. It then propagates out through both atria, including bachmann’s bundle in the left atrium, and contracts both atria. Then, it’s delayed just a little bit as it goes through the atrioventricular node, or AV node, before it passes through the Bundle of His and to the Purkinje fibers of the left and right ventricles, causing them to contract as well.   On an electrocardiogram, the P-wave corresponds to atrial contraction, the PR interval corresponds to the slight delay through the AV node, and the QRS complex corresponds to ventricular contraction.Now, in a normal electrical conduction system, the AV node is the only place where the signal can get through to the ventricles from the atria. It’s kind of like there’s a gatekeeper that has to stop the signal and make sure everything’s good before letting it pass, so there’s always a slight delay here. People with WPW essentially have a secret, backdoor entrance. Because this entrance is secret, it doesn’t have a gatekeeper; therefore, there’s no delay as the signal moves through it. This secret backdoor entrance is a tiny bundle of cardiac tissue that conducts electrical signals really well, called the Bundle of Kent. Using the Bundle of Kent means the ventricles start to contract a little bit early, which is called pre-excitation. If the Bundle is on the left side of the heart, it’s called “type A pre-excitation.” If it’s on the right side, it’s called “type B pre-excitation.” Type A, on the left side, is a lot more common.   All right, even though one signal sneaks through early, the other signal waiting at the AV node eventually makes its way through, and the two signals essentially combine to contract the ventricles. So, on an ECG, people with WPW have a short PR interval with a delta wave, as well as QRS prolongation, which makes sense because the signal’s taking the shortcut and contracting the ventricles early. This means the PR interval is shorter, and the overall QRS complex is longer. People with WPW usually have a PR interval less than 120 ms and a QRS complex greater than 110 ms. Also, the ST segment and T wave, which represent repolarization, will often be directly opposite the QRS complex. This WPW pattern doesn’t typically cause any symptoms and is relatively benign.  However, in some cases, this pattern can facilitate certain arrhythmias, make certain arrhythmias more severe, and potentially even cause sudden cardiac death. When this happens, it’s called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. For example, people with atrial arrhythmias might have atrial rates in the 200 to 300 beats per minute range. Normally, the AV node doesn’t allow all of these signals through, and so the ventricles will contract at a lower number; for example, for every three atrial beats, there’s only one ventricular beat, so for 300 beats per minute in the atrium, the ventricle would go for 100 beats per minute.   For people with a Bundle of Kent, however, those signals aren’t held up at the AV node, so the ventricles contract at the same rate as the atrium; in our example, that’s at 300 beats per minute, which is way too fast for the ventricles. This can quickly lead to cardiogenic shock because the heart doesn’t even have time to fill with blood before each contraction; it’s barely pumping any blood.  In other cases, the extra pathway can set up a reentry circuit. In the event of a reentry circuit, the signal might move back up the accessory pathway, because the majority of Bundles of Kent are actually bidirectional, which means that the signal can go from atrium to ventricle as well as from ventricle to atrium. For example, an electrical signal could go down the AV node, through the ventricles, and then up the Bundle of Kent, causing the atria to contract, and then go back down the AV node, contracting the ventricles again; next, it would go back up the Bundle of Kent, creating a reentry circuit. This type, where the signal goes from ventricle to atrium, is called Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, or AVRT, with orthodromic conduction; this can lead to very high ventricular rates between 200 and 300 bpm.  Less commonly, the signal can move in the opposite direction, which is called AVRT with antidromic conduction. These circuits can be initiated by several mechanisms, such as premature contractions in the atria or ventricles.  It’s estimated that about one in 1000 people have Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, which is congenital and present at birth. A small proportion of this already small number go on to have the symptoms that we just discussed.   If they do develop dangerous tachyarrhythmias, they may be treated pharmacologically, but a definitive treatment is radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway, or the Bundle of Kent. This treatment uses cautery to destroy the pathway, essentially boarding up the secret back door, which leaves behind only one connection between the atria and the ventricles: the AV node.\n",
            "Ventricular refers to the bottom chambers of the heart, the right and left ventricles, as opposed to the top chambers, the right and left atria. Tachycardia refers to a fast heart rate. Typically, a tachycardic, or fast, heart rate is considered anything above 100 beats per minute, or bpm. However, ventricular tachycardia is different than a fast heart rate from exercising, which is called sinus tachycardia. Normally, the electrical signals that generate each heartbeat start in the right atrium at the sinus node, which is also known as the sinoatrial node, or the SA node. If the rate goes over 100 bpm and originates in the SA node, it’s considered sinus tachycardia, which is totally normal.However, heartbeats can become abnormal if the electrical signals don’t start in the SA node, but start in the ventricles instead. Premature Ventricular Contractions, or PVCs, are single beats originating from the lower chambers. Any time there are more than three beats like this in a row, then it’s defined as ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia, sometimes called V-tach, or VT, can cause the heart rate to rise above 100 beats per minute, which can be extremely dangerous and lead to sudden cardiac death.Hold on, how can that happen? It’s not like while we exercise we’re risking sudden cardiac death, right? Well, even though we say tachycardia is anything above 100 beats per minute, most patients with ventricular tachycardia experience heart rates as high as 250 beats per minute. 250 beats per minute mean that the heart is beating over four times per second.  When the chambers are pumping that fast, they don’t have enough time to even fill with blood, so the heart is furiously pumping out only tablespoons of blood to your body, and most importantly, to your brain, which is just not enough. If this happens, a person can have symptoms from not having enough perfusion to their tissues, such as chest pain, fainting, dizziness, or shortness of breath. It can even cause sudden death.   Now, there are essentially two ways an electrical signal can start in a ventricle: either the signal is focal, or it’s reentrant. Focal V-tach happens when a specific area of the ventricle has abnormal automaticity. The automaticity rate is the frequency at which a cell sends out a signal, so for the pacemaker cells in the SA node, the rate is between about 60 and 100 signals per minute, resulting in 60 to 100 beats per minute. Let’s just say 60 beats per minute, so one beat every second. Some specialized pacemaker cells in the ventricles also have this ability; they’re just usually a lot slower, making about 30 beats per minute, or one beat every two seconds. So, in most cases, the SA node fires signals off a lot faster, which sends electrical waves throughout the atria and ventricles. This doesn’t give the ventricular pacemaker cells a chance to ever have just two seconds of peace, which is what they need before they fire at a rate of 30 bpm.   For example, imagine all the other pacemaker cells stopped suddenly. After two seconds, the ventricular cells would initiate a signal, right? Now, if a certain area of ventricular tissue gets stressed or irritated in some way, the ventricular pacemaker cells might start firing at higher rates. They essentially flip roles with the SA node, firing so fast that the pacemaker cells in the SA node don’t get a chance to fire; at this point, the heartbeat is being driven by the ventricles. This stress might be triggered by: certain medications; illicit drugs, such as methamphetamine or cocaine; electrolyte imbalances; and ischemia to the ventricular muscle.   However, it’s more common for V-tach to be reentrant, as opposed to focal. So, let’s take a closer look at the cardiomyocytes, or heart muscles cells, instead of the pacemaker cells. These can be stressed in a similar way, which might change a couple of their properties, including how fast they relay, or conduct the signal to the next cell, and how long their refractory period is. Now, the refractory period is the period right after conducting a signal when the cells can’t conduct another signal.   All right, to help explain this, let’s say the myocardial tissue on side A conducts really fast, so the electrical signal zips through; however, it takes a long time to be able to conduct again. In other words, it has a long refractory period. The other side, or side B, is the exact opposite; it has slow conduction and a short refractory period. Now, this isn’t entirely unusual, since the heart can naturally have tissue with different properties. But let’s say that this tissue becomes damaged, and some of these cells actually die, like with a heart attack. Well, now you’ll get some scar tissue, which really can’t conduct the signal as well. Sometimes, this can create a sort of split pathway, where it  goes around the scar and meets back up on the other side. Under these conditions, it’s possible that a reentrant circuit develops. Okay, if one signal comes through, that’s fine. On side A, the wave makes it around first and goes on to the rest of the ventricle, and contracts the ventricle. It also starts up the other path, and sort of runs into the other, slower wave, which is called a unidirectional block.   Now, side A goes into its long refractory period, and side B goes into its short refractory period. Basically, side B comes out of refractory first. If another signal comes early, while side B’s ready but side A isn’t ready, and is still in refractory, it’ll be stopped on the A  side, right?   It’ll move down side B. If, by the time the signal makes it down the slow side B, side A is now out of refractory, the signal can re-enter the circuit, essentially moving up side A. It then gets back to the top of side A, then goes down side B again, basically coming down and going back up again.   This can happen again and again. Every time you go around, you get a ventricular contraction, or a heartbeat! This is what can lead to reentrant ventricular tachycardia.  Now, the type of ventricular tachycardia is diagnosed via electrocardiogram, or ECG. ECGs measure the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes that are placed on the skin. A normal ECG looks something like this, with characteristic waves PQRST, and sometimes U. This big guy in the middle, the QRS complex, represents the depolarization, and therefore the contraction, of the ventricular muscle fibers.   During ventricular tachycardia, you’ll typically see something like this. Each of these represents a ventricular contraction. When they all look the same, it’s called monomorphic, because it just has one morphology, or one form. This is typically the case for reentrant circuits, since there’s only a single spot where everything’s starting from. It’s also the case for focal VTs when one group of cells is responsible.  However, sometimes the VT can be polymorphic, which means that the shape changes from beat to beat because the signal’s originating from different points in the ventricles. Polymorphic VT might happen when multiple areas of pacemaker cells become irritated and develop increased automaticity rates, such as from severe hypoxia, for example.   Having V-tach is very dangerous, and it can develop into another dangerous rhythm called Ventricular fibrillation. Both of these conditions require immediate medical attention. VT is treated with cardioversion; either drug cardioversion or electrical cardioversion can be used. Drug cardioversion involves a drug treatment that aims to lower the heart rate back to a normal rhythm. Electrical cardioversion, on the other hand, uses an electrical pulse of energy delivered to the heart that is synchronized with the fast rate that will be delivered on the R-wave, which is the peak of the QRS complex. This is done to try to avoid delivering it during a vulnerable period on the T wave in which electrical cardioversion could induce ventricular fibrillation. Sometimes, patients might have a radiofrequency catheter ablation, where radiofrequency waves are used to heat up and destroy the tissue that’s causing the irregular heartbeat; this can essentially cure certain tachycardias. Other times, patients prone to having bouts of ventricular tachycardia will have a small device capable of delivering electrical cardioversion called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD, surgically implanted.\n",
            "Brugada syndrome is named after Pedro and Josep Brugada, two cardiologists (and brothers!) who recognized a specific pattern of ventricular fibrillation on the electrocardiogram readings of previously healthy individuals who died suddenly. They discovered that some of these cases could be traced back to a specific genetic cause, and their findings have since been known as Brugada syndrome. Many individuals with Brugada syndrome don’t have an identifiable genetic cause, but in some individuals, the role their genes play is very clearly defined. The most well-known of these genetic causes is a mutation in the gene SCN5A. This SCN5A mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single mutation is enough to cause the disease. SC5NA codes for sodium ion channels in the cell membranes of cardiac muscle cells, and a faulty sodium ion channel affects the ability of these cells to conduct an action potential. The result, then, is that some regions of the heart end up repolarizing abnormally. In some cases, the heart might have a normal rhythm at first, which can then develop into a Brugada syndrome rhythm in the presence of certain medications like sodium channel blockers. On an electrocardiogram, Brugada syndrome typically has ST elevations (which are often a sign of ventricular strain), as well as a right bundle branch block, which indicates that the ventricles aren’t depolarizing normally. As a result, these regions become susceptible to what’s called a reentrant loop, which is when a depolarization signal starts circling around and around in a loop, causing ventricular tachycardia and sometimes ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation, sometimes called v-fib, means the heart’s muscle fibers start quivering because they’re not contracting at the same time. Normally, an electrical signal spreads quickly enough that all the muscle fibers in the ventricles contract at pretty much the same time, which essentially looks like a single, coordinated contraction. If they don’t all contract around the same time, not much gets accomplished. It’s kind of like a rowboat—it works best when everyone rows at the same time, right? Well with v-fib, all the rowers stop rowing together and just row whenever they want, and the rowboat just moves in circles, and eventually sinks. Just like the rowboat, If the heart’s not squeezing anymore, and it’s just squirming around “like a bag of worms”—which is actually the description used to used explain what a heart experiencing v-fib looks like—then you can probably guess that this situation is extremely dangerous. It’s dangerous because your body, and especially your brain, isn’t getting fresh oxygen; because of this, ventricular fibrillation can lead to death within minutes of onset, and this is called sudden cardiac death.Individuals with Brugada syndrome are usually healthy before dying suddenly. In some cases, individuals survive their first episode of an arrhythmia, which might cause palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue, and are then diagnosed after experiencing these symptoms. Other times, when someone dies suddenly of cardiac death, their relatives get gene tested, and the cause of death is unfortunately only determined to be Brugada syndrome post-mortem. Individuals found to have Brugada syndrome while they’re alive can have a cardiac defibrillator implanted, so that it can take over if or when they experience further episodes of ventricular fibrillation.\n",
            "The heart has two lower chambers, called the ventricles, and a premature ventricular contraction is when the ventricles contract earlier than normal in the cardiac cycle. This happens because an abnormal contraction signal, called a depolarization, originates from somewhere in the ventricles rather than coming from the pacemaker cells.So normally, the sinoatrial, or SA, node sends an electrical signal called a depolarization that propagates out through the walls of the heart and causes both upper chambers to contract. Then, that signal moves to the atrioventricular, or AV, node, where it’s delayed for a split second. Then, the signal travels down into the ventricles, or lower chambers, where it moves down the bundle of His into the left and right bundle branches and into each ventricle’s Purkinje fibers, causing them to contract as well. This trip is called a depolarization wave, and in a healthy heart, it makes sure that the upper chambers contract before the lower chambers contract. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which measures the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes that are placed on the skin, the atrial depolarization and its contraction are seen as a P-wave, the ventricular contraction is seen as a QRS complex, and the ventricular repolarization and its relaxation are seen as a T-wave. This empty space is called the PR segment, and it corresponds to the pause in the AV node. This one is called the ST segment, and it corresponds to the interval between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Finally, this one is called the TP segment, which represents the heart’s quiet time, which happens when the cells are finished repolarizing and are ready for another signal. Now, if we just look at the QRS complex, which normally lasts less than 100 milliseconds or 2-and-a-half little boxes, it’s usually made up of three smaller waves, also called deflections. If the first wave after the P-wave is downwards, or negative, it’s called a Q wave, and a way to remember that is by thinking that the letter Q has a downward tail. If the next deflection is upward, or positive, then it’s called the R-wave. However, if the first wave after the P-wave is upwards, or positive,  instead, you basically skip the Q and just called it an R-wave. Finally, any downward deflection after the R-wave is called the S-wave. Now, the interesting thing is that in addition to the pacemaker cells in the SA node, cells in the AV node, Bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers, all have the ability to generate an electrical potential. Those last three are called latent pacemakers, and they have slower depolarization rates — which is the rate at which they fire off electrical signals — and these depolarization rates get slower as you move further down the heart. Let’s use this bar to visualize the SA node’s depolarization rate, which is the fastest, and then each one below is slightly slower. Notice that each time the SA node fires, it resets all the slower ones. If, for example, the SA node stopped firing action potentials altogether, then the AV node would take over at its slightly slower pace. Now, though, let’s say you have an ectopic focus, which is a cell or area of tissue that sends off an early depolarization wave before even the SA node gets to fire, somewhere in the ventricles. This is what leads to a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC.A latent pacemaker cell or cardiac muscle cell could depolarize early if it experiences enhanced automaticity, which might result from irritating stressors like electrolyte imbalances, drugs like cocaine or methamphetamines, ischemic damage like a heart attack, or anything that increases sympathetic activity, like anxiety. Ectopic beats can also be caused by triggered activity, which is when cells depolarize early. The exact mechanism here is unclear, but it might be due an ion channel dysfunction that leads to an unexpected change in the membrane potential during or right after repolarization. When a cell depolarization happens during ventricular repolarization, it’s called an early-afterdepolarization, and if the depolarization happens after repolarization is finished, it’s called a delayed-afterdepolarization. A final type of ventricular ectopic focus is a reentrant loop, where a depolarization wave encounters tissue that doesn’t depolarize, which could happen in scar tissue after a heart. The wave starts going around and around that tissue, forming a reentrant loop. A reentrant loop basically starts sending out depolarization waves to the rest of the heart tissue each time the wave goes around. If the ectopic focus originates in the right ventricle, the depolarization wave will depolarize the right ventricle first and then the left ventricle. This produces a QRS complex that looks like a left bundle branch block. If the ectopic focus originates in the left ventricle, the wave will depolarizing the left ventricle first and then the right ventricle, and this produces a QRS complex that looks like a right bundle branch block. Now, lead V1 on an ECG measures a depolarization wave that moves towards the right ventricle. So, when an ectopic focus originates in the left ventricle and moves towards the right ventricle, the V1 lead shows a large positive complex with a dominating R-wave. When an ectopic focus originates in the right ventricle and then moves towards the left ventricle, the V1 lead shows a large negative complex with a dominating S-wave. Regardless of the originating ventricle, a premature ventricular contraction often has an abnormal T-wave because the timing and direction of repolarization will be abnormal as well.Let’s say that a heart’s cruising along at about 60 beats per minute, which means that there’s one second between P-waves and QRS complexes. All of a sudden, an ectopic focus in the ventricles fires off, contracting the ventricles. That wave of depolarization tries to travel up to the atrium, but because this happens so close to the previous depolarization, the atrium’s still in its refractory period and the wave is stopped at the AV node. A split second later, the ventricle enters its refractory period. Since the sinus node is depolarizing at a rate of one second per beat, and it’s out of refractory, it fires off a signal and the atria contract. This creates another P-wave that’s right on schedule. Because the ventricle’s in refractory now, though, it doesn’t contract. Next, both the atrium and the ventricle relax and come out of refractory. Exactly one second later, the sinus node sends another signal, the atrium contracts as it should, and everything carries on as usual. This situation is called a compensatory pause, which is defined as having a normal sinus complex landing exactly two times the normal sinus interval. Here, the normal sinus interval is one second, so one times two equals two seconds. We end up with a long pause — specifically, one that’s greater than the sinus interval — between ventricular contractions. A longer time between contractions means that the ventricles fill up more, and this means the heart contracts with greater strength, which can be felt as a palpitation.Now, let’s run a slightly different scenario. Here, the premature ventricular contraction occurs after the atrium comes out of refractory. In this case, the wave of depolarization makes it into the atrium and depolarizes the atrium, including the sinus node. Essentially, this means that the sinus node resets about 4.4 boxes, or 0.88 seconds, from the last. In this case, after being depolarized, the sinus node waits its one second, and then sends another signal; again, we carry on as normal. This is called a noncompensatory pause, because the sinus complex lands less than two the normal sinus interval. This is how you can tell whether or not the PVC depolarized the atrium.A ventricular ectopic focus can fire at different points in the cardiac cycle, and this affects how an ECG will look. First, the ectopic focus might fire during a P-wave. Sometimes, this can get completely lost in the QRS complex, but it can sometimes be found if you search for it. Next, the ectopic beat could happen during the PR segment, and because the ectopic depolarization happens relatively slowly, it will often combine with the normal depolarization wave coming down the ventricular conduction system, resulting in a ventricular fusion beat. These can look lots of different ways depending on where the two depolarization waves meet each other. Early after-depolarizations might start during the ST segment or even during the T-wave, and that’s called R-on-T phenomenon. This used to be considered an ominous sign of an impending, dangerous arrhythmia, but recent studies show that the relationship between R-on-T phenomenon and arrhythmia are more complex than we once thought.Sometimes, premature ventricular contractions can keep happening instead of being isolated events. For example, ventricular bigeminy is when a premature ventricular contraction consistently comes after each normal cardiac cycle. Ventricular trigeminy, on the other hand, is when a premature ventricular contraction consistently comes after every two normal cardiac cycles.  Also, you might have multiple ectopic foci premature ventricular contractions that produce differently appearing QRS complexes on a single rhythm strip.Now, most people with premature ventricular contractions don’t notice them, but if these keep occurring, they can cause lightheadedness because less blood is being delivered to the brain. In rare situations, an ectopic focus can trigger ventricular tachycardia or even ventricular fibrillation, which are more serious arrhythmias where the ventricles beat too quickly to fill up with an adequate amount of blood. The diagnosis of a premature ventricular contraction is based on the ECG, but sometimes a Holter monitor, which is like a continuous ECG monitor used over a few days, is needed to capture the event. Typically, premature ventricular contractions don’t need treatment, and if there is an obvious cause, like a particular medication or use of a substance, then stopping that typically resolves the issue.  If the premature ventricular contractions keep happening or cause palpitations, they can be treated with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, both of which prevent the heart from beating too strongly. If an ectopic focus is triggering ventricular arrhythmias, radiofrequency ablation, which is where radiofrequency waves are used to destroy the tissue that’s causing the ectopic heartbeat, can be done.\n",
            "Ventricular refers to the bottom chambers of the heart, the right and left ventricles, rather than the top chambers, the right and left atria. Fibrillation means quivering from uncoordinated muscle fiber contraction. So, ventricular fibrillation, sometimes called v-fib or VF, means that the heart’s muscle fibers start quivering because they’re not contracting at the same time.  Normally, an electrical signal spreads fast enough that all the muscle fibers in the ventricles contract at almost the same time, which essentially acts like a single, coordinated contraction. If they don’t all contract at about the same time, not much gets accomplished. It’s kind of like a rowboat; it works best when everyone rows at the same time, right?Well, with VF, all the rowers stop rowing together, and just row whenever they want; the rowboat just moves in circles, and eventually sinks. Just like a rowboat, if the heart’s not squeezing anymore, and it’s just squirming around “like a bag of worms” — a common description of what it looks like — then you can probably guess that this situation is extremely dangerous. Because your body, and especially your brain, isn’t getting fresh oxygen, ventricular fibrillation can lead to death within minutes of onset, which is called sudden cardiac death.  Now, the exact mechanisms leading up to VF aren’t always super clear because it’s hard to know what’s happening in the heart immediately before VF. Most often, however, the heart cells become stressed or damaged in such a way that different areas of tissue are structurally and electrically changed, and thus have different properties; this known as tissue heterogeneity. When they’re homogenous, or the same, they all behave in the same ways and can depolarize and contract at nearly the same time. When the tissues have different electrical properties, they aren’t as good as working together, and are more prone to abnormal behavior and depolarizing on their own. In general, tissue heterogeneity can happen after something stresses the ventricular muscle, such as: certain medications; illicit drugs, like methamphetamine or cocaine; electrolyte imbalances; and ischemia to the ventricular muscle.   When a group of ventricular pacemaker cells starts firing at the wrong time, if the surrounding cells have the same or nearly the same properties, that signal radiates outward simultaneously, causing the ventricles to contract; this is called a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC. Although it is not the norm, it is a relatively benign phenomenon and can even be seen sometimes in otherwise healthy hearts. However, having more than three PVCs in a row is called ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia can sometimes progress to ventricular fibrillation.  In our example, let’s imagine that surrounding cells have very different properties; maybe some cells don’t conduct the signal as fast as other cells. Instead of radiating outward uniformly, the wave of conduction can start to curve, and ultimately ends up literally spiraling out of control; therefore, the wavefront circles back on itself, and initiates another depolarization. This situation is called functional reentry. That spiral can spread and break down into other mini spirals, leading to fibrillation and to the different areas of the heart depolarizing and contracting at different times.   Alternatively, the reentry behavior can start because of the presence of scar tissue, which can happen after a heart attack; because scar tissue isn’t electrically conductive, the signal just goes around and around the scar. In this case it’s known as anatomical reentry.   One last means of inducing fibrillation is through electrocution, or external electrical stimulation. Here’s a normal reading of the heart’s electrical activity, as shown by an electrocardiogram or ECG. We call these waves PQRST, and sometimes U. The QRS complex, right in the middle, corresponds to the ventricles contracting. If the heart tissue is stimulated at just the right time, during the upslope of the T wave, it can actually induce fibrillation.  Right after the ventricles contract, the cells enter into a refractory period, during which they can’t be stimulated to contract again. During the upslope of the T wave, some cells are starting to come out of refractory, so those cells might be ready to go again, whereas other cells might still be in a refractory phase.   Therefore, some cells might contract, and some might not; this can lead to abnormal conduction, which could lead to a similar reentry phenomenon we just talked about.   During VF, the whole PQRST breaks down completely, and all you see are these small “fib waves”; each one corresponds to an area of the ventricle depolarizing on its own. One of the only ways to stop fibrillation once it’s started, unless it breaks on its own, is external electrical stimulation, or defibrillation. This is typically a high-energy shock meant to depolarize at least a large enough portion of heart tissue, or a critical mass, to allow the sinus node, or the heart’s main pacemaker, to take control again. Basically, we’re trying to interfere and stop all the reentry spirals at the same time. It would be similar to the captain of our rowboat getting on the loudspeaker and screaming to get everyone’s attention all at once.  Sometimes, patients might be given an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. ICDs are surgically implanted, and can constantly monitor a patient’s ECG. If the patient’s ECG suddenly breaks down into fib waves, the device recognizes it is as VF, and promptly delivers a defibrillating shock. Patients may also be given medications following a VF event to help reduce the likelihood of episodes in the future. Although ICDs and medication can’t fix the underlying condition that ultimately leads to VF, they have been shown to be very beneficial and effective at improving survival.\n",
            "Each heartbeat starts with the heart’s pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, sometimes just called the SA node, in the right atrium. The SA node sends an electrical signal that propagates out through the walls of the heart and contracts both upper chambers, then moves through the atrioventricular node, or AV node, where the signal stops for a split second. Next, the signal goes down into the lower chambers, where it moves down the bundle of His, into the left and right bundle branches, and into each ventricles’ Purkinje fibers, causing them to contract as well. So, in a healthy heart, the upper chambers contract first, and then shortly after, the lower chambers contract.   On an ECG, the atrial contraction is seen as a “P wave,” and the ventricular contraction is seen as the “QRS complex.” The interval from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex is called the “PR interval,” and is normally between 120 and 200 milliseconds, or 3-5 tiny boxes on the graph paper that it’s usually printed out on, since each box is 40 milliseconds or 0.04 seconds. Heart block describes a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal rhythm, that happens when the electrical signal gets delayed or blocked entirely at some point along the conduction system.  These blocks and delays usually happen because of some sort of damage or fibrosis to the electrical conduction system, the pathways that conduct the electrical signal. Lev’s disease, or Lenegre-lev syndrome, describes the large proportion of cases that are idiopathic and described as progressive cardiac conduction defects. This means it’s not clear exactly what causes it, but over time fibrosis, or scarring, develops in the conduction system which can delay or stop electrical conduction. This is usually a result of the aging process in the heart, and happens most often in the elderly, although some hereditary forms have been identified and can happen in younger people. However, another large proportion of cases are a result of ischemic heart disease, which is when the heart cells don’t receive enough oxygen and can die off, as with a heart attack. This again leaves scar tissue that can block the electrical signal. In fact, it’s estimated that about 20 percent of patients that have a heart attack go on to develop a heart block.   Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the electrical conduction system is kind of like the electrical wiring in the walls of a house, so it makes sense that diseases of the heart muscle walls — or, cardiomyopathies — and inflammation of the heart muscle — or, myocarditis — can both cause heart block.  An atrioventricular, or AV block, describes when the signal is delayed or blocked when it’s trying to move from the atria to the ventricles. First-degree AV block is when the signal is delayed, but still makes it to the ventricles. This type has a PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds. Even though these signals are delayed, in first degree block, they still reach the ventricles. First degree block isn’t usually associated with any symptoms. Treatment or management of first degree block might involve identifying electrolyte imbalances or causes due to medications, but it usually doesn’t require further treatment.  Second degree AV block can be split into two types. Type I, called “Mobitz I,” or sometimes “Wenckebach,” happens when the PR interval gets progressively longer with each beat until a P wave is blocked completely. So, maybe the first PR interval is 200 ms, then the next is 260 ms, then 300 ms, and finally the next one doesn’t make it to the ventricles, and you get what’s called a “dropped beat.”   When a signal doesn’t make it to the ventricles from the atria, and if a long enough time passes by — let’s say about 2 seconds — then the ventricles’ pacemaker cells kick in, sort of as a fail-safe mechanism, called a ventricular escape beat. Most people with this type don’t have symptoms, but occasionally patients feel lightheadedness, dizziness, and syncope.   Second degree AV block, called Type II, or “Mobitz II,” is similar to Type I AV block in that you get intermittent dropped beats. However, this time they happen fairly randomly, so you don’t have the progressive lengthening of the PR interval. A lot of times, a ratio for the overall number of beats conducted to not-conducted is given, like 2:1 Mobitz II AV block, but again, remember that the dropped beats happen fairly randomly so we can’t really predict exactly when the next beat will get dropped. Most people with Mobitz Type II do feel symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope, though the severity can vary from patient to patient. Third degree, or complete heart block, describes when the signal is completely blocked while moving from the atria to ventricles, every time. So in this case, even though the atria might be going along at 60 bpm as if everything was normal, none of those signals make it down to the ventricles, and the ventricles struggle along with escape beats at very slow rates, probably closer to 30 bpm. Patients with complete heart block are usually symptomatic, with symptoms such as syncope, confusion, dyspnea, and severe chest pain. These patients are at risk of dying.When someone has AV block, it’s important to find out the underlying cause and address it. For example, it could be an adverse effect from a medication or from an infection. In terms of treating the AV block, typically a medication can be used to increase the heart rate, like atropine. Alternatively, transcutaneous pacing might be used, where electrical pacing of the heart is done through electrodes placed on the skin. If the underlying cause is irreversible and the AV block is severe, patients ultimately might need a permanent pacemaker, which is implanted to continually monitor the patient’s rhythm. If it detects a delay, it’ll send an electrical impulse into the ventricles, causing them to contract.\n",
            "Each heartbeat starts with the heart’s pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, sometimes called the SA node, in the right atrium. The SA node sends out an electrical signal that propagates out and contracts both upper chambers. The signal then moves through the atrioventricular node, or AV node, down into the lower chambers. Here it reaches the bundle of His and splits into the left and right bundle branches, which serve the left and the right ventricles. The signal then goes on to each ventricles’ Purkinje fibers, which leads to ventricular contraction.Now, a “bundle branch block” describes when that electrical signal gets completely blocked or held up along one of the bundle branches. In most cases, this block, or delay, is caused by fibrosis, or scarring, that either occurs acutely or chronically. Acute causes can be things like ischemia, heart attack, or myocarditis, the inflammation of the heart tissue. Chronic conditions might lead to fibrosis of the heart tissue, because they all can cause slow and steady remodeling of the heart muscle; these include: hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathies.  If the block happens on the right side, it’s referred to as a right bundle branch block. With this type, the electrical signal starts at the SA node, contracts the atria, moves through the AV node, splits at the bundle of His, and then moves down the left bundle branch, but is blocked on the right bundle branch. This causes the left ventricle to contract first. The signal then spreads from the purkinje fibers of the left ventricle over to the right ventricle, which causes the right ventricle to contract after the left has contracted. So, with right bundle branch block, the right ventricle contracts late. If the block happened to be on the left side instead, which is called a left bundle branch block, the signal would be delayed on that side, and so the right ventricle would contract first, and then the left ventricle would contract late.Now, on electrocardiogram or ECG, normally you have the characteristic P wave, which corresponds to the atria contracting, then the QRS complex, which corresponds to both ventricles contracting and is usually between 80 and 100 ms long. If there’s a delay in depolarization of one of the ventricles, the QRS complex gets wider because depolarization starts on time but ends later than usual. Because now one of the ventricles is contracting late, a QRS complex longer than 120 ms is common to see in a bundle branch block. Okay, so far we’ve been looking a relatively common view of the heart, called lead two, which is a type of “limb lead,” since we get it by attaching leads to two limbs: the right arm and left leg. Even though this lead can provide some solid information, it’s often helpful to use other leads as well, especially when differentiating between left and right bundle branch block. The chest leads, or precordial leads, are really useful for doing just that. Chest leads look at the heart’s electrical activity when viewed from a slice parallel with the ground, whereas limb leads look at the heart in the frontal plane, which is perpendicular to the ground.For chest leads, they go from V1, coming straight out the front of the chest, to V6, going out the left side of the chest. Each of these is like looking at the heart from a different perspective, right? V1 and V6 are particularly helpful since they’re the farthest apart from each other, and therefore have the most contrast between views. Normally, the first thing to depolarize is the septum, and the wave of depolarization moves from the left bundle branch toward the right ventricle, so toward V1 but away from V6. This  means you’ll get a positive deflection on V1, and a negative deflection on V6. Next, that wave moves to the ventricles themselves, and since the left ventricle is usually more massive, you’ll get a large depolarization directed away from V1 but toward V6, so negative on V1 and positive on V6. Let’s say there’s a block along the left bundle branch, so now the overall direction of depolarization comes from the right side and moves toward the left, so away from V1 and toward V6, meaning negative in V1 and positive in V6. V6 will also often be notched from the left ventricle, depolarizing late. So, when it’s all said and done, V1 usually has a QS or “little r”-S complex, because QS means an absent R wave, and “little r”-S means a small R wave, either of which give it a “W” shape. On V6, the large “notched” R wave gives it an “M” shape.  All right, now let’s say there’s a block on the right bundle branch. The first part is actually similar to the normal situation, so the septum depolarizes from the left bundle branch toward the right ventricle, so toward and positive in V1, and away and negative in V6. Next, the left ventricle depolarizes and you get a negative deflection in V1 and a positive deflection in V6. Finally, as the right ventricle depolarizes in a roundabout sort of way, you get a positive deflection in V1 and negative in V6. So, V1 has a large terminal R wave, meaning it ends with a large R wave, and this gives it an ‘M’ shape. On V6, there should be a slurred S wave, giving it a W shape. Now, if we take a look at all these, you’ve got W-shape in V1 and M-shape in V6 for left bundle branch block, but an  M-shape in V1 and a W-shape in V6 in right bundle branch block, which gives us this awesome mnemonic: WiLLiaM MaRRoW. Nailed it.  Some cases of bundle branch block are present since birth, don’t cause symptoms, and therefore probably don’t need treatment. In a lot of cases though, the block is acquired through some other heart disease. In severe cases, when the block is accompanied by heart failure, a special cardiac resynchronization pacemaker can be implanted that has electrical leads going to both the left and right ventricles.These leads can pace the ventricles at the same time, causing them both to contract at the same time, which helps improve cardiac function.\n",
            "The tricuspid valve has three leaflets: the anterior, posterior and medial or septal leaflets. Together, these separate the right atrium from the right ventricle. During systole, or muscle contraction, the tricuspid valve closes, and during diastole, or heart relaxation, the tricuspid valve opens and lets blood fill the right ventricle. Tricuspid valve regurgitation happens when the tricuspid valve doesn’t close completely and blood leaks back from the right ventricle into the right atrium. Tricuspid valve stenosis happens if the tricuspid valve can’t open completely, making it difficult to fill the right ventricle.Let’s start with tricuspid valve regurgitation. Often, regurgitation is due to pulmonary hypertension which causes an increase in right ventricular pressure. This pressure then dilates the tricuspid valve, allowing blood to go backward. Another well-known cause of regurgitation is rheumatic heart disease, an autoimmune reaction that involves the valve leaflets and causes inflammation. This chronic inflammation leads to leaflet fibrosis, which makes it so that they don’t form a nice seal and instead let blood leak through. Still another cause of tricuspid regurgitation is damage to the papillary muscles from a heart attack. If these papillary muscles die, they can’t anchor the chordae tendineae, which then allows the tricuspid valve to flop back and allows blood to flow backward from the right ventricle into the right atrium. There are also congenital causes for this condition, like Ebstein’s anomaly, which is when a person is born with leaflets that are located too low, i.e., in the ventricle rather than between the atria and the ventricle, and this makes it hard for the leaflets to form a nice seal.In all of these situations, blood flows back into the right atrium during systole. This movement of blood can be heard as a holosystolic murmur, because it’s possible to hear blood flowing through the valve for the duration of systole. Another possible effect is Carvallo’s sign, which is when the murmur gets louder with inspiration, or inhalation. This happens because the negative pressure in the chest brings more blood back up into the heart, and more blood makes the murmur even noisier. Now, that extra blood that flowed backward into the atrium during systole ends up draining right back into the ventricle during diastole. This mean’s there’s an increase in right ventricular preload. It’s kind of like if you were digging a hole and every time you shoveled some dirt out, half of it fell back in; that’s a lot of wasted work.Eventually, to deal with this extra blood and the extra work required to pump it out, the right ventricle grows larger, a process called eccentric ventricular hypertrophy. In this situation, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones. This remodeling, or structural change, in the heart stretches the annulus, or ring of the valve, letting more blood leak back into the atrium and actually therefore worsening the regurgitation.This compensation works for a while, but eventually the right ventricle might not be able to keep up with the backflow of blood. This can lead to right-sided heart failure, which causes symptoms like distended neck veins,  swelling of the ankles and feet, and blood backed up to the liver, which causes hepatosplenomegaly, or swelling of the liver and spleen. Diagnosis is usually done with an echocardiogram, and treatment for tricuspid regurgitation is usually aimed at maintaining good fluid balance. Only rarely is valve repair or replacement needed.Let’s switch gears to tricuspid valve stenosis, where the tricuspid valve doesn’t open all the way during diastole, or filling. This is most often caused by rheumatic fever, and if the tricuspid valve is affected, then the mitral and aortic valve are almost always affected as well. In this case, as a result of inflammation, the leaflets can fuse together, and this is called commissural fusion. When this happens, the normal tricuspid valve opening narrows, making it a lot harder for blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. When the blood finally pushes open the fibrotic valve, this makes a distinctive “snap” sound, which is followed by a diastolic rumble as blood is forced through the smaller opening. Since it’s harder for blood to get through the valve, blood volume and pressure increase in the right atrium, This increased right atrial volume and pressure causes the atrium  to dilate, which can result in blood getting backed up into the veins. In addition, when the right atrium dilates, the muscle walls stretch and the pacemaker cells that run through these walls become more irritable, which increases the risk of arrhythmias like atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Just like regurgitation, tricuspid valve stenosis can lead to right-sided heart failure. Again, this leads to symptoms like distended neck veins, swelling of the ankles and feet, and blood backing up into the liver, causing hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is usually done with an echocardiogram, and treatment of tricuspid valve stenosis usually involves a balloon valvuloplasty, which means that a balloon is inserted and then inflated to open the narrowed valve and allow more blood to flow through it.\n",
            "The pulmonary valve is typically made up of three leaflets, the anterior, the left, and the right, and it opens during systole to allow blood to be ejected to the lungs. During diastole, it closes to allow the heart to fill with blood and get ready for another systole. If the pulmonary valve doesn’t open all the way, it makes it harder for the heart to pump blood out to the lungs, and this is called pulmonary stenosis. If the pulmonary valve doesn’t close all the way, then blood leaks back into the right ventricle, and this is called pulmonary valve regurgitation or pulmonary insufficiency.Pulmonary valve stenosis is often congenital, meaning that at birth, the leaflets are irregularly shaped or not fully developed. Pulmonic valve stenosis is often associated with congenital heart conditions like Tetralogy of Fallot, which affects all four chamber of the heart, as well as a genetic condition called Noonan's syndrome. In other cases, pulmonary valve stenosis can be caused by mechanical stress over time, which damages endothelial cells around the valves. This damage causes fibrosis and calcification, which harden the valve and make it more difficult for the valve to open all the way. Because pulmonary valve stenosis makes it harder for the valve to open when the right ventricle tries to eject blood, the valve resists for a second before finally snapping open, and this causes a characteristic “ejection click.” Because the blood has to flow through a narrow opening, we get increased turbulence, which creates a noise called a murmur. This murmur gets louder as more blood flows past the opening, and then it gets quieter as the amount of blood flowing through the valve decreases because There’s less in the ventricle. This sound is described as a crescendo-decrescendo murmur. Since it’s more difficult to open this hardened valve and push blood past it, the right ventricle has to generate really high pressures. To achieve those pressures it thickens its muscles, and this is called concentric right ventricular hypertrophy. This happens because new sarcomeres are added in parallel to the existing ones. However, even though you have this bulked up ventricle, the heart still might struggle to get enough blood through the narrowed opening and the lungs. Ultimately, that means that blood gets backed up, and so the person can develop right-sided heart failure. A final, different complication of pulmonic valve stenosis is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and it’s the damage caused to red blood cells as they’re forced through the smaller valve. This splits them into smaller fragments called schistocytes, which leads them to get peed out and to hemoglobinuria, or hemoglobin in the urine. When the blood is backed up into the body, this can lead to distended neck veins, swelling of the ankles and feet, and hepatosplenomegaly, which is an enlarged liver and spleen. Because less blood is able to get into the lungs, it can also cause symptoms like cyanosis, which is blue or purple discoloration of the skin, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue, which are most noticeable when the body’s demand for oxygen is high, like during exercise. Diagnosis is usually done with an echocardiogram, and treatment of pulmonic valve stenosis usually involves a balloon valvuloplasty, which means that a balloon is inserted and then inflated to open the narrowed valve and allow more blood flow through it. With pulmonary regurgitation, the valve doesn’t close all the way during diastole, or ventricular filling, so blood ends up flowing back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. Regurgitation can happen due to valvular damage, which could caused by something like infective endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart. Another cause of pulmonary regurgitation is rheumatic heart disease, where chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis. Here, instead of fusing the valve leaflets together, the fibrosis prevents the leaves from forming a nice seal, and instead they let blood leak through. Sometimes, pulmonic regurgitation can be caused by previous heart surgeries: a balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for pulmonary stenosis could have opened the valve too far, or the person might have a malfunctioning prosthetic valve. In pulmonary regurgitation, the blood leaking back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle causes a diastolic decrescendo murmur. It’s considered a decrescendo murmur because it starts out loudest and then becomes more quiet over time. The backflow of blood increases the right ventricular blood volume and the amount of work that the right ventricle has to do during systole. This means that, over time, the right ventricle grows larger, and here we call this process eccentric ventricular hypertrophy. In this situation, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones. This compensation works for a little while, but eventually the right ventricle might not be able to keep up, which can lead to right-sided heart failure. Initially, pulmonary valve regurgitation might cause no symptoms at all. Over time, though, it can lead to right-sided heart failure, which can cause the blood to back up and symptoms like distended neck veins, swelling of the ankles and feet, and hepatosplenomegaly. Like with pulmonary valve stenosis, diagnosis is usually done with echocardiogram. Treatment for pulmonary regurgitation is usually valve replacement if right-sided heart failure develops.\n",
            "The mitral valve has two leaflets: the anterior leaflet and the posterior leaflet. Together, they separate the left atrium from the left ventricle. During systole the valve closes, which means blood cannot do anything but be ejected out of the aortic valve and into circulation.   If the mitral valve doesn’t completely shut, blood can leak back into the left atrium; this is called mitral valve regurgitation. During diastole, the mitral valve opens and lets blood fill into the ventricle. If the mitral valve doesn’t open enough, it gets harder to fill the left ventricle; this is called mitral valve stenosis.  Let’s start with mitral valve regurgitation. The leading cause of mitral valve regurgitation, and the most common of all valvular conditions, is mitral valve prolapse. When the left ventricle contracts during systole, a ton of pressure is generated so that the blood can be pumped out of the aortic valve; therefore, a lot of pressure pushes on that closed mitral valve. Normally, the papillary muscles and connective tissue, called chordae tendineae or heart strings, keep the valve from prolapsing, or falling back into the atrium.   With mitral valve prolapse, the connective tissue of the leaflets and surrounding tissue are weakened; this is called myxomatous degeneration. Why this happens isn’t well understood, but it is sometimes associated with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Myxomatous degeneration results in a larger valve leaflet area and elongation of the chordae tendineae, which can sometimes rupture; this rupture typically happens to the chordae tendineae on the posterior leaflet, and can cause the posterior leaflet to fold up into the left atrium.Patients with a mitral valve prolapse are usually asymptomatic, but often have a classic heart murmur that includes a mid-systolic click, which is sometimes followed by a systolic murmur.   The click is a result of the leaflet folding into the atrium and being suddenly stopped by the chordae tendineae. Although mitral valve prolapse doesn’t always cause mitral regurgitation, it often does. If the leaflets don’t make a perfect seal, a little bit of blood leaks backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium, causing a murmur.  The mitral valve prolapse murmur is somewhat unique in that when patients squat down, the click comes later and the murmur is shorter, but when they stand or do a valsalva maneuver, the click comes sooner and the murmur lasts longer.   This happens because squatting increases venous return, which fills the left ventricle with slightly more blood; this means that the left ventricle gets just a little bit larger. Therefore, the larger leaflets have more space to hang out, and as the ventricle contracts and gets smaller, it takes just a little longer for the leaflet to get forced into the atrium. Standing, on the other hand, reduces venous return, meaning there’s a little less blood  in the ventricle and, by extension, a little less room to hang out; thus, the leaflet gets forced out earlier during contraction. The other heart murmur that follows this pattern is the one present in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  So, in addition to mitral valve prolapse, another cause of mitral regurgitation is damage to the papillary muscles from a heart attack. If these papillary muscles die, they can’t anchor the chordae tendineae, which then cause the mitral valve to flop back and allow blood to go from the left ventricle to the left atrium.  Left-sided heart failure that leads to ventricular dilation can also lead to mitral regurgitation, because as the left ventricle dilates, it stretches the mitral valve annulus, or ring, open and lets blood leak into the left atrium.   Mitral regurgitation can also be caused by rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease that can affect the heart tissue and lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease. The chronic inflammation from rheumatic fever leads to leaflet fibrosis, which prevents the leaflets from forming a nice seal, and instead they let blood leak through. Patients with mitral valve regurgitation typically have a holosystolic murmur, meaning it lasts for the duration of systole.   Now, even though we said that left-sided heart failure can cause mitral regurgitation, it also goes the other way; mitral regurgitation can be a cause of left-sided heart failure. With mitral regurgitation, every time the left ventricle contracts, some blood is inadvertently pumped out into the left atrium, which leads to increased preload as that blood is again drained back into the left ventricle after contraction. It’s kind of like if you were digging a hole and every time you shoveled some dirt out, half of it would fall back in. That’s a lot of wasted work, right?  When this happens, both the left atrium and ventricle experience volume overload. To better manage this larger volume, the left side of the heart undergoes eccentric hypertrophy; here, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones, and it grows larger. This compensation works for awhile, but eventually the left ventricle might not be able to keep up, and it can lead to left-sided heart failure.  All right, let’s switch gears to mitral valve stenosis, which is most often caused by rheumatic fever. In this case, instead of the inflammation causing the leaflets not to form a good enough seal, the leaflets can fuse together; this is called commissural fusion. When this happens, the normal mitral valve opening, which is about 4 to 6 cm2, can narrow down to 2cm2. This makes it a lot harder for blood to flow from the left atrium to left ventricle, so the volume of blood in the left atrium increases, leading to higher pressures in the left atrium. Higher pressures flowing through a fibrotic valve make a “snap” sound when the valve opens, which is followed by a diastolic rumble as the blood is forced through the smaller opening.  A constant elevation in both blood volume and pressure in the left atrium causes it to dilate, and can allow blood to back up into the pulmonary circulation; this causes pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema, which can lead to symptoms like dyspnea, or difficulty breathing. All this extra blood volume causes higher pressures in the pulmonary circulation, or pulmonary hypertension, which can ultimately make it harder for the right ventricle to pump blood to the lungs. Therefore, over time the right ventricle can hypertrophy and ultimately fail, which is called right-sided heart failure.  Additionally, when the left atrium dilates, the muscle walls stretch and the pacemaker cells that run through the walls become more irritable, which increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. During atrial fibrillation, the right and left atrium don’t contract properly anymore, causing more blood to stagnate. Since the left atrium is already pretty dilated, static pools of blood can become a major risk for thrombus formation, and if a blood clot forms, it can immediately get into the systemic circulation. Finally, let’s think about the heart in relation to other structures in the chest. If the atrium dilates and gets really large, it can compress its neighbor, the esophagus, and patients might have difficulty swallowing solid foods, which is called dysphagia. For patients with severe problems related to mitral regurgitation or stenosis, treatment involves valve repair or surgical replacement of the valve.\n",
            "The aortic valve is typically made up of three leaflets: the left, the right, and the posterior leaflet. The aortic valve opens during systole to allow blood to be ejected to the body. During diastole, it closes to allow the heart to fill with blood and get ready for another systole. If the aortic valve doesn’t open all the way, it gets harder to pump blood out to the body; this is called aortic stenosis. If it doesn’t close all the way, then blood leaks back into the left ventricle; this is called aortic valve regurgitation or aortic insufficiency.Usually, the aortic valve opens to about 3-4 cm2, but with stenosis it can become less than 1 cm2. This is usually caused by mechanical stress over time, which damages endothelial cells around the valves, causing fibrosis and calcification, which hardens the valve and makes it more difficult to open completely. This type usually shows up in late adulthood, typically in patients over 60 years old.   Similarly, patients that have a bicuspid valve — with two leaflets — as opposed to a tricuspid — with three leaflets — are more at risk of fibrosis and calcification because the mechanical stress that’s usually distributed between three leaflets is now split by only two leaflets. Therefore, there is more stress per leaflet. Another important cause of aortic stenosis is chronic rheumatic fever, which can cause repeated inflammation and repair, leading to fibrosis. In this case, the leaflets can actually fuse together — called commissural fusion — which can be an important distinction from the type caused by mechanical stress over time.  When the valve fuses together or hardens, it doesn’t open as easily, right? And so as the left ventricle contracts, it creates this high pressure that eventually pushes on the valve until it finally snaps open, causing a characteristic “ejection click.” Since the blood has to flow through a narrow opening, there’s turbulence which creates noise, or a murmur, which gets initially gets louder as more blood flows past the opening, and then becomes quieter as the amount of blood flowing subsides because less remains in the ventricle. This is called a crescendo-decrescendo murmur.   Since now it’s harder to open and push blood past this hardened valve, the left ventricle has to generate higher pressure each time it contracts to get the same amount of blood through. To accomplish this, the left ventricle can thicken its muscles, called concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. This happens because new sarcomeres are added in parallel to the existing ones.   Even though you have this bulked-up ventricle, the heart still might struggle to get enough blood through the narrowed opening and the body, and ultimately to the vital organs. This means that the person’s at risk of developing heart failure, and various symptoms related to whichever organ is involved. For example, if there’s a reduction in blood flow to the brain, it could lead to syncope. A reduction in blood flow through coronary arteries to the heart’s own myocardium could cause chest pain and angina. Patients might not initially experience symptoms at rest, but only during exercise, because exercise requires more blood, right? And the heart isn’t able to increase blood flow through this small opening. A final complication is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is essentially damage to red blood cells as they’re forced through the smaller valve, splitting them into smaller fragments called schistocytes. This leads to hemoglobinuria, which is hemoglobin in the urine. Treatment is usually replacement of the valve, which often doesn’t happen until after the onset of symptoms.  All right, so that was aortic stenosis. What about aortic regurgitation? Well, normally right after the ventricle pumps blood out through the aortic valve, the valve shuts and remains shut until the ventricle fills again. With aortic regurgitation, sometimes called aortic insufficiency, blood flows back from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, or during ventricular filling. About half of cases are caused by aortic root dilation. This is when the root dilates, or gets bigger, and in doing so pulls apart the leaflets, making it harder for the valves to fit snugly together and close all the way, letting some blood flow backward. The vast majority — about 80% — of aortic root dilations are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown. The remaining 20% are causes like aortic dissection, aneurysms, and syphilis, all of which can ultimately lead to widening the aortic root. Besides root dilation, regurgitation may happen due to valvular damage, such as from something like infective endocarditis—a bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart—or again, from chronic rheumatic fever. In this situation, the chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis, but instead of fusing the valve leaflets together, it makes it so that they don’t form a strong seal, and instead let blood leak through. Patients with aortic regurgitation will have an early decrescendo diastolic murmur, caused by the blood flowing back through the valve.  Because blood is leaking back from the aorta into the left ventricle, the left ventricular blood volume increases, which increases the stroke volume, or the amount of blood that the left ventricle pumps out during contraction, or systole. More blood pumped out of the heart per squeeze requires more pressure, so systolic blood pressure increases. During diastole, though, there’s less blood volume in the aorta because some has leaked back into the ventricle, which means that diastolic blood pressure decreases.   A higher systolic pressure and lower diastolic pressure means an increase in pulse pressure, which is just systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure. A large pulse pressure, meaning a large difference between systolic and diastolic pressure, is referred to as a hyperdynamic circulation. Patients with a hyperdynamic circulation have bounding pulses, or water-hammer pulses, because the blood — which is mostly composed of water — slams like a hammer against the walls of the arteries with each heartbeat. These bounding pulses can be dramatic enough that they cause head bobbing that’s in tune with the heartbeat, and can cause the capillary beds in the fingernails to pulsate, sometimes called Quincke’s sign.  Over time, the increase in blood volume in the left ventricle causes the chamber to grow larger; this is called eccentric ventricular hypertrophy. In this situation, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones. Just like aortic stenosis, treatment for aortic regurgitation is replacement of the valve after symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction develop.\n",
            "Cardiomyopathy translates to “heart muscle disease,” so cardiomyopathy is a broad term used to describe a variety of issues that result from disease of the myocardium, or heart muscle. When cardiomyopathy develops as a way to compensate for some other underlying disease, such as hypertension or valve diseases, it’s called secondary cardiomyopathy. When it develops all by itself, it’s called primary cardiomyopathy.Now, the most common type is dilated cardiomyopathy, which can cause all four chambers of the heart to dilate, or get bigger. Specifically, new sarcomeres, or muscle units, in the walls are added in series, and the chambers grow larger, which leaves the walls relatively thin compared to the large chamber size, with less muscle to use for contraction.In other words, they have really weak contractions, which means less blood is pumped out each contraction. This also means that there’s a lower stroke volume, and if the heart’s failing to pump out as much blood to both the body from the left ventricle, and the lungs from the right ventricle, patients develop biventricular congestive heart failure. Since contraction happens during systole, we say this is a type of systolic heart failure.  Also, when the chambers get larger, they tend to stretch out the valves that separate the atria and ventricles. When they are stretched, the valves can’t close all the way, so they start to regurgitate blood back into the atria. This is called mitral valve regurgitation on the left side, and tricuspid valve regurgitation on the right. Mitral valve regurgitation might be heard on auscultation as a holosystolic murmur, meaning that it happens throughout systole.Additionally, you might also hear an S3 heart sound on auscultation, which is the result of blood rushing and slamming into the dilated ventricular wall during diastole.Another complication can be arrhythmias, because stretching out the muscle walls can irritate the cells in the conduction system, which are within those walls. Sometimes, an X-ray can be helpful for a diagnosing dilated cardiomyopathy.As far as causes go, primary dilated cardiomyopathy is most often idiopathic, meaning there isn’t a clearly identifiable cause. Some cases, however, can be traced back to specific genetic mutations or genetic conditions, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and hemochromatosis. Also, in some cases it can be caused by an infection, like coxsackievirus B, which causes myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — or Chagas disease, a protozoal infection. Also, alcohol abuse is strongly linked to dilated cardiomyopathy because alcohol and its metabolites have a direct toxic effect on the myocardium.  Similarly, certain drugs, including chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, but also drugs like cocaine, can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Also, wet beriberi, having too little Vitamin B1, or thiamine, can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is an important cause as well, because dilated cardiomyopathy can develop in the third trimester of pregnancy or in the weeks following delivery, probably due to issues like pregnancy-associated hypertension. However, about half of patients recover following pregnancy. As you can see, there are a lot of things that can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Regardless of the cause, the outcome is less effective systolic function. Treatment for severe dilated cardiomyopathy can include a left ventricular assist device, or an LVAD, which is a mechanical pump that assists the heart in distributing blood. In extreme cases, someone might have a heart transplant.### SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium which causes all four chambers of the heart to get bigger. Because heart walls will be thin compared to the large chambers, this can result in weak contraction, low stroke volume, and congestive heart failure. It can also cause valve regurgitation and arrhythmias. Treatment, in extreme cases, is to do a heart transplant.\n",
            "Cardiomyopathy means “heart muscle disease,” so cardiomyopathy is a broad term used to describe a variety of issues that result from disease of the myocardium, or heart muscle. When cardiomyopathy develops as a way to compensate for some other underlying disease, like hypertension or valve diseases, it’s called secondary cardiomyopathy; when it develops all by itself, it’s called primary cardiomyopathy.Now, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is when the walls get thick, heavy, and hypercontractile; essentially, the muscles grow a lot larger because new sarcomeres are being added parallel to existing ones. Usually, the left ventricle is affected, and in most cases, this muscle growth is asymmetrical, meaning that the interventricular septum grows larger relative to the free wall. These larger muscles do two things: the walls take up more room, so less blood is able to fill the ventricle; and they become more stiff and less compliant, so they can’t stretch out as much, again, leading to less filling. When the ventricles don’t fill as much, they don’t pump out as much blood, and so stroke volume goes down. Thus, the heart can fail to pump enough blood to the body; this is called heart failure. Because this is due to a dysfunction in filling, which happens during diastole, this is a type of diastolic heart failure. In some patients, the muscle growth of the interventricular septum essentially gets in the way of the left ventricular outflow tract during systole, or ventricular contraction. This increases blood velocity through the smaller opening, and pulls the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve toward the septum. This is called the venturi effect, which further obstructs the left ventricular outflow tract. For this reason, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is sometimes called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. An obstructed left ventricular outflow tract means blood is forced through a tiny opening, which tends to cause a crescendo-decrescendo murmur. A crescendo-decrescendo murmur gets louder as blood first rushes out, and then softer; this is very similar to the murmur in aortic valve stenosis.However, the intensity of the murmur caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can change depending on how much the outflow tract is obstructed. If the person squats down or does a handgrip maneuver, systemic vascular resistance increases, which makes it harder to eject blood out and increases afterload. This means that the ventricle has more blood stretching it out, so it becomes less obstructed, and the murmur becomes less intense.  If the person stands upright or does a valsalva maneuver, however, venous return decreases. This decreases preload, meaning less blood is stretching out the ventricle before ejection, and the obstruction gets larger; thus the murmur’s intensity increases. Also, people with obstructive Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might have a bifid pulse. Here, two pulses are felt because the mitral valve is moving toward the outflow tract and causing increased obstruction mid-systole. So, with larger muscle mass, the ventricles become less compliant. Remember, this means that they don’t stretch as easily when filled with blood. If you’re listening on auscultation, often an S4 sound can be heard from the atria contracting and pushing blood into a non-compliant ventricular wall during diastole. Another thing to know is that those larger muscles need a lot of oxygen. We just talked about how the heart has a harder time getting blood, and therefore oxygen, to the tissues, right? Well, without oxygen they can become ischemic; this is thought to be the reason why people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes develop dangerously fast arrhythmias, and why hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden death in young individuals, and especially young athletes. A bit less severe symptoms of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might include dyspnea, which is difficulty breathing, or syncope, which is fainting. Now, the majority of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by a genetic missense mutation, which happens when a single nucleotide is swapped, causing a different amino acid to be coded. This type of mutation usually happens in one of the genes that encode proteins in the sarcomere of heart muscle. The beta-myosin heavy chain is the most common, but it could also be mutations in the myosin binding protein C and Troponin T. A classic finding on histology is myocyte disarray, where instead of making nice parallel lines, myofibers don’t line up. Also, people with Friedreich's Ataxia, which is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, often develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might involve medications, such as beta blockers, which help slow down the heart rate. If the patient doesn’t tolerate those well, calcium channel blockers, like verapamil or diltiazem, might be used. However, digoxin, a medication used occasionally for heart conditions, is contraindicated because it tends to increase force of contraction, which can actually increase the obstruction as blood is forced out of the ventricle. Besides pharmacological treatments, some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might have surgery.### SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap.... Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is when the walls of the heart get thick, heavy, and hypercontractile. It usually affects the left ventricle, causing symptoms like a lower stroke volume, an obstructed left ventricular outflow tract during systole, a variable crescendo-decrescendo murmur, a bifid pulse, and dangerously fast arrhythmias. It is most commonly caused by a genetic mutation affecting proteins in the sarcomere of heart muscle.\n",
            "Endocarditis means “inflammation of the inner layer of the heart.” The heart’s wall is made up of three layers: the epicardium, the outermost layer; the myocardium; and then the endocardium, which is the layer that gets inflamed.  It turns out that most cases of endocarditis are due to a microbial infection of the endocardium, usually involving the endocardium lining the cardiac valves. Why the valves? Well, it turns out that the valves have tiny blood vessels that nourish them, even though they’re flopping around in blood all day long. This means that an infection can potentially result from a damaged valve, because it would allow microbes to escape the tiny blood vessels and invade the valve tissue, or on the flip side, microbes in the blood might enter the tiny vessels within the valve.   Either way, a microbe has to first get into the bloodstream, and that might happen if a person: has an open wound or an abscess; a dental or surgical procedure; or, an injection with an infected needle or infected substance, from using illegal drugs.   Most often, the valves on the left side — the mitral valve and the aortic valve — are affected, sometimes due to predisposing conditions, such as mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valves, but it really depends on the circumstances. Risk factors for either valve include having prosthetic valves, congenital cardiac defect involving the valves, damage to the valves from rheumatic heart disease, and intravenous drug use, which typically affects the tricuspid valve.  Now, the first step that happens in endocarditis is that the endothelial lining of the valve gets damaged. There are a number of ways this can happen, such as previous inflammation or injury. This damage exposes the underlying collagen and tissue factor, causing platelets and fibrin to adhere, which forms this tiny thrombosis or blood clot. This is called Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis, or NBTE. It’s nonbacterial because it happens even before the bacteria shows up. Now, if you add in bacteriemia, or bacteria in the blood, you’ve got yourself a recipe for infective endocarditis.   Every day, there are opportunities for microbes to get into the bloodstream, whether it’s through brushing your teeth and having them slip into the gums, or having them slip in through your gut or lungs. Whatever the case, they regularly make their way into the body. It’s not usually not a problem though, because it’s a small amount and can easily be killed by your immune system. However, occasionally they float around in the blood for long enough to find an NBTE, which serves as a perfect location for them to attach and set up an infection, called a vegetation. To attach to an NBTE, a lot of bacterial species use proteins on their surface, called adhesins, that let them stick to the valve and stick to one another. They also create an extracellular matrix around themselves, called biofilm, which allows them to literally stick together and form a large clump of bacteria that can behave like a colony.  Usually, these guys stick to areas of lower pressures, since it’s easier to adhere. So, let’s take mitral valve regurgitation, where blood flows backward from the higher pressure left ventricle to the lower pressure left atrium. In this case, vegetations will tend to form on the lower pressure atrial surface. Not only will they form here, they’ll also form on the edge of the opening, due to the venturi effect. The venturi effect describes how fluid pressure decreases as it flows through a narrowed opening, while its velocity increases. So, as blood forces its way through the opening, pressure is lower near the edges.   If the person has aortic regurgitation, meaning that blood is going from the higher pressure aorta to the lower pressure ventricle, then vegetations tend to be located on the lower pressure ventricular surface of the valve.  Infective endocarditis used to be classified into acute and subacute groups, based on how quickly the infection developed, but nowadays the key is to identify the microbial cause of infection and treat it as effectively as possible.Viridans Streptococci is the most common cause. Its virulence is low, it’s found in the mouth, and it usually attacks valves that have had some previous damage that resulted in small vegetations that didn’t destroy the valve.Staphylococcus aureus, on the other hand, is a highly virulent bacteria that can be found on the skin.This guy can infect both damaged and healthy valves, and particularly, the tricuspid valve. S aureus causes large vegetations that can destroy the valve. This bacteria is most commonly contracted from intravenous drug use.Next, we have Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a bacteria that loves foreign prosthetic material, like prosthetic heart valves. One way that the bacteria gets into the body is at the time of heart valve surgery, when it literally sticks around on the valve. Another common point of entry into the body is through an infected intravenous catheter. Both of these scenarios usually happen in a hospital, so either would be considered a nosocomial infection.Two other bacterial species are Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus bovis, which are both normally found in the gut flora. However, when somebody has severe colorectal disease, like colorectal cancer or ulcerative colitis, these gut bacteria can migrate across the gut lining and into the bloodstream, which is a setup for potential endocarditis. An even more unusual bacteria is Coxiella burnetii, which patients typically contract after exposure to infected animals, such as cows, sheep, and goats. The bacteria initially causes a disease called “Q fever.” Months, or sometimes years, after the initial Q fever, patients can develop endocarditis, but usually this is in high-risk people: patients who are immunocompromised; pregnant women; and those with pre-existing heart valve defect, which makes it tricky to diagnose unless there’s a reason to suspect it.  Finally, a group of organisms that are less commonly associated with endocarditis are the HACEK organisms. These guys are a group of gram-negative bacteria that are also part of the normal flora of the mouth and throat. Each letter of HACEK stands for a different genus: Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella.  Now, people with infective endocarditis almost always have a fever, and a new heart murmur that results from turbulent blood flow past a damaged heart valve. Sometimes, the vegetations can detach from the valve, and little clumps of pathogens, called septic emboli, can float through the bloodstream.  These guys can lodge under the fingernails, causing splinter hemorrhages, or in the palms and soles of the feet, causing small painless, flat, and erythematous lesions, called Janeway lesions. In contrast, there might be an immune reaction with antigen-antibody complexes that form and deposit in different parts of the body. In the fingers and toes, these complexes can lead to painful lesions called Osler’s nodes. In the eye, these deposits can lead to Roth spots. In the kidney, they can lead to glomerulonephritis.   Diagnosing the cause of infective endocarditis typically involves getting positive blood culture, which means growing bacteria from a blood sample. Echocardiography can also be used to visualize the heart and look for vegetations or more subtle clues, like the way the valve’s moving. Depending on the organism that caused the infection, a prolonged course of antibiotics will likely be used to try and wipe out the infection, but surgery might be needed for severe cases, especially when the valve dysfunction causes heart failure. It’s also important to prevent endocarditis, especially among high risk groups, such as people with prosthetic heart valves or a history of endocarditis. Before dental procedures, sometimes these people are recommended antibiotics; remember, some of those microbes that cause endocarditis live in the mouth.Finally, there’s Libman-Sacks endocarditis, which is not infection-related. This one’s usually associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, which is an autoimmune disease involving antigen-antibody complexes. In this case, they settle in the endocardium and cause inflammation. These areas of inflammation can happen anywhere on the valve surface or chordae tendineae, but typically happen on the mitral valve, which leads to mitral valve regurgitation. In this case, inflammation can also happen on the atrial endocardium or ventricular endocardium.\n",
            "With myocarditis, myo- means muscle, card- means heart, and -itis means inflammation. So, myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium, which is the muscular middle layer of the heart wall, which contracts and relaxes so the heart can pump blood all around the body.Inflammation in the myocardium layer causes swelling, which damages the heart muscle cells’ ability to contract. That means that less blood gets pumped out of the heart with each heartbeat. If myocarditis is severe enough, it can lead to heart failure, which is when the heart can’t keep up with the demands of the body. Once the inflammation resolves, the heart contraction typically returns to normal, but occasionally, when the inflammation is really severe, it can cause fibrosis, or scar tissue, in the myocardium. Scar tissue doesn’t contract normally, so if that happens, it can cause long term problems with heart contraction.In North America, viral infections, specifically Coxsackievirus B infections, are the main cause of myocarditis. Viral infections can trigger lymphocytic myocarditis, which is when lymphocytes - the B and T cells of the immune system - and water make their way into the  interstitial space - the space in between heart muscle cells. There are plenty of other infectious causes as well, though. One of these is trypanosoma cruzi, a single-cell protozoan that causes Chagas disease throughout South America. In Chagas disease, under a microscope, it’s possible to see groups of amastigotes within the heart muscle cells, which are trypanosomes that are in the intracellular stage. As a result, the heart muscle cells necrose or die. There’s  also Trichinella, a roundworm that moves from the intestines into various parts of the body, causing a variety of problems, including myocarditis. Myocarditis can also be seen in Lyme disease which is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is spread by deer ticks. Finally, in immunocompromised individuals, there’s Toxoplasma gondii, a single-cell parasite harbored by cats, that can cause myocarditis. Those were the infectious causes, but there are also non-infectious causes of myocarditis as well. These include systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus, and polymyositis, a generalized inflammation of the muscles, where the immune system starts to attack the myocardial layer of the heart. There’s also drug-associated myocarditis, which means there’s an adverse drug reaction that inflames the heart. Drug reactions cause a hypersensitivity myocarditis, which is when eosinophils get into the blood vessels in the myocardium.  Finally, there’s giant cell myocarditis, which causes inflammation in the heart, from an unknown cause. The key finding is that macrophages - immune cells that engulf foreign substances - start to fuse together to form a single giant cell, hence the name. Individuals with myocarditis can have chest pain that is sometimes positional, meaning that it can get better or worse depending on the body’s position. It can also cause arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, because the inflammation affects the pacemaker cells traveling through the myocardium. There can also be more general symptoms like fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. In severe cases, where myocarditis starts to develop into heart failure, there can be additional symptoms like fluid retention in the feet and ankles. Individuals with myocarditis suffer heart muscle damage, which causes troponin and creatine kinase levels to rise on blood tests. An electrocardiogram can show sinus tachycardia, a fast heart rate, as well as T-wave inversions and “saddle-shaped” ST-segment elevations because it looks a bit like a horse saddle. In addition,a chest X-ray might show an enlarged heart, while echography might show inflamed heart muscle walls. Ultimately, the diagnosis is based on a biopsy of the cardiac muscle but doing that procedure comes with some risk so it’s not always done. The treatment of myocarditis depends on the underlying cause. Viral myocarditis usually improves slowly over time, and other infections are treated with appropriate antibiotics. If there are signs of heart failure, then they are typically managed with medication and careful fluid balance. Arrhythmias usually resolve as the inflammation improves as well. Finally, in severe cases, like some cases of Chagas myocarditis and giant cell myocarditis a heart transplant can be needed if other treatments don’t work.\n",
            "With pericarditis, “peri” means “around,” card means “the heart”, and itis means “inflamed”. So pericarditis means the pericardial layer of tissue that covers the heart has inflammation. Acute pericarditis generally lasts just a few weeks, whereas chronic pericarditis lasts longer, usually more than 6 months. People who develop pericarditis are also at risk of also developing a pericardial effusion - that’s when the inflammation causes fluid to accumulate around the heart. The pericardium is a pouch or cavity that the heart sits inside of. The outer layer of this pouch is the fibrous pericardium and it helps keep the heart in place within the chest cavity. The inner layer of the pouch is the serous pericardium that includes the pericardial cavity, and is filled with a small amount of fluid that lets the heart slip around as it beats. The cells of the serous pericardium secrete and reabsorb the fluid, so usually there’s no more than 50 milliliters of fluid in the pericardial cavity at one time -  that’s about as much as a shot glass.Now, the cause of acute pericarditis is usually idiopathic, meaning that we don’t know what causes it. When the cause is identified, it’s usually a viral infection, like Coxsackie B virus. Another cause is Dressler syndrome which occurs several weeks after a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Basically, when heart cells die in a myocardial infarction, it leads to massive inflammation that also involves the serous pericardium. Another cause of pericarditis, called uremic pericarditis, is when blood levels of urea, a nitrogen waste product, get really high usually due to kidney problems. The high levels of urea irritate the serous pericardium, making it secrete a thick pericardial fluid that’s full of fibrin strands and white blood cells. This gives the wall of the serous pericardium a “buttered bread” appearance.Pericarditis can also be seen in autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or systemic lupus erythematosus, because the immune system attacks its own tissues, including the pericardium. Other causes of pericarditis include cancer, radiation therapy in the chest, and even medications like penicillin, and certain anticonvulsants.  Regardless of the cause, inflammation in the pericardium means that fluid as well as immune cells start moving from tiny blood vessels in the fibrous and serous pericardium into the tissue or interstitium of those layers, making the layer itself a bit thicker and more boggy - think of how a piece of dry flat pasta gets cooked and thickens up as it soaks up fluid. Now, a pericardial effusion can also develop. That’s when pericardial fluid begins to pool in the pericardial space, because the serous pericardium can’t remove it as quickly as it comes in. If a lot of fluid starts to collect in the pericardial space - in other words, if that pericardial effusion gets really big, then it can start putting pressure on the heart itself, preventing it from fully stretching out or relaxing between contractions. This can lead to tamponade physiology which is where the cardiac chambers can’t fill with blood properly, causing a decrease in  cardiac output - which can be a medical emergency. When the inflammation persists for weeks to months, the process is called chronic pericarditis. In chronic pericarditis, immune cells initiate fibrosis of the serous pericardium which can produce a inelastic shell around the heart making it hard for the ventricles to expand—it’s like the heart is being squeezed by a boa constrictor. Over time, it becomes harder for the heart to relax or expand, and the stroke volume - the amount of blood the heart squirts out with each heartbeat goes down, and to compensate the heart rate goes up. This is similar to tamponade physiology but happens more gradually and is a result of a change in the composition of the serous pericardium, rather than a fluid collection around the serous pericardium. The main symptom of pericarditis is fever and chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, but improves with sitting up and leaning forward. Larger pericardial effusions, those over 100ml of fluid, can cause diminished heart sounds, and can even diminish cardiac output leading to shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and lightheadedness.There are a few ways to diagnose pericarditis and pericardial effusions. First, when the thickened layers of the pericardium rub up against each other - it creates a friction rub which can be heard on auscultation. It sounds like two pieces of leather rubbing against each other. Next, on an electrocardiogram, there are a few changes that you can expect to see. In the first couple days to weeks, there can be ST segment elevations and PR segment depressions. After that, the T waves tend to flatten and then becomes inverted over a few weeks, and then eventually the ECG returns back to normal. On an ECG, pericardial effusions, especially large ones, can show low QRS complex voltage or electrical alternans, which is where the QRS complexes have different heights, as a result of the heart swinging back and forth in a pool of pericardial fluid. On an X-ray of a heart with a large pericardial effusion, you can see a silhouette that pools to the bottom of the heart and gives a classic “water bottle” sign. On an echocardiogram, a pericardial effusion makes the heart looks like it’s dancing within the pericardium, whereas chronic pericarditis shows the stiff serous pericardium restricting the heart’s movement.In terms of treatment, the main goal is to relieve pain with analgesic medication, and to treat the underlying cause of inflammation. If there’s a severe pericardial effusion, a pericardiocentesis can be done by inserting a needle into the pericardial cavity and draining the excess fluid.\n",
            "The name “cardiac tamponade” can be broken down: “tamponade” refers to pressure which obstructs blood flow, and “cardiac” refers to the heart. So in cardiac tamponade there’s a buildup of fluid in the pericardium, and that fluid puts pressure on the outside of the heart. As a result, the heart is unable to pump normally and blood flow is obstructed.  Normally, the heart sits inside a two-layered pouch or cavity called the pericardium. The outer layer is the fibrous pericardium, which helps keep the heart in place within the chest cavity. The inner layer of the pouch is the serous pericardium, which includes the pericardial cavity; it’s filled with a small amount of fluid that lets the heart slip around as it beats. The cells of the serous pericardium secrete and reabsorb the fluid, so usually there’s no more than 50 milliliters of fluid in the pericardial cavity at any time—that’s about as much as would fit into a shot glass.A pericardial effusion happens when this normally protective fluid begins to pool in the pericardial space. It can develop into cardiac tamponade depending on how much fluid there is and how quickly that fluid accumulates. A rapid accumulation of fluid can occur as a result of trauma to the chest. For example, a stab wound can puncture a blood vessel and fill the pericardium with blood. Even blunt trauma like a steering wheel getting pushed into your chest during a car crash can lead to tamponade, because the force of the impact causes the rupture of lots of small blood vessels. Cardiac tamponade can also happen a few days after a myocardial infarction, because the weak, infarcted ventricular wall ruptures when it’s exposed to the high ventricular pressures. It’s a bit like how jeans might tear at the spot where the denim is worn away and already quite weak. A rare cause is heart surgery, where, once again, a weakened muscle can rupture and cause cardiac tamponade days after the operation. Yet another cause is aortic dissection, which is when blood pools in the actual wall of the aorta. If the aortic dissection ruptures through the wall of the aorta and through the fibrous pericardium, blood can spill right into the pericardial cavity, leading to cardiac tamponade. In these situations, even a small volume—as little as 150 ml!—can lead to tamponade, because the pericardium doesn’t have time to stretch and accommodate it. Other causes of cardiac tamponade involve more long-term factors, rather than sudden trauma. In these cases, the fluid comes from a chronically inflamed serous pericardium that can’t resorb pericardial fluid as quickly as it builds up. Long-term causes of cardiac tamponade include cancers that have spread to the pericardium, often from the lung and the breast. Another cause is uremic pericarditis, where blood levels of urea, a nitrogen waste product, get really high, usually due to a kidney problem. The high levels of urea in the blood irritate the serous pericardium. More rarely, cardiac tamponade can happen due to hypothyroidism or because of chronic inflammation from a connective tissue disease. In these situations, when fluid accumulates gradually, the pericardium can hold as much as 1.5 L of fluid before tamponade sets in.So, in cases of cardiac tamponade, fluid puts pressure on the heart itself, preventing it from fully stretching out or relaxing between contractions. This means that the cardiac chambers can’t fill with blood properly, causing a decrease in cardiac output or a lower amount of blood being squeezed out with each heartbeat, which leads to hypotension. Less blood leaving the heart also means less blood reaching the organs and tissues, and the heart tries to compensate for its low output by beating faster. When a person suffering from cardiac tamponade breathes in, the systolic blood pressure sometimes drops. Normally, inspiration creates a tiny bit of negative pressure which pulls blood into the heart, momentarily increasing systemic venous return. When that happens, the right heart volumes increases, and the right ventricle expands a bit into the pericardial space, so it doesn’t affect the left heart volume at all. During inspiration in someone with cardiac tamponade, the right ventricle can’t move into the pericardial space, so the extra volume pushes the interventricular septum leftwards. This leads to a reduction in left ventricular diastolic volume, a lower stroke volume, and a drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. A decrease in the systolic pressure of greater than 10 mmHg is called pulsus paradoxus, and it’s a classic sign of cardiac tamponade.In tamponade, there’s also trouble in the upper heart chambers: the atria can’t distend enough to accommodate the venous blood returning to the heart. That blood will have nowhere to go but back into the veins. That’s why you’ll typically see distended jugular veins when you look at the neck of a person with cardiac tamponade. This sign is actually part of a triad of symptoms called Beck’s triad: distended neck veins, hypotension, and distant heart sounds on auscultation. Although not part of the triad, tachycardia and coughing can also develop. People with tamponade will experience dyspnea (labored breathing), as well as weakness and lightheadedness. If it gets severe enough, the heart can ultimately start getting ischemic and stop beating altogether. This dangerous situation requires immediate drainage of pericardial fluid.A diagnosis of cardiac tamponade often starts with an ECG reading. Classic findings include tachycardia, a low QRS complex voltage, and electrical alternans, which is when the QRS complexes have different heights. Echocardiography can show the excess pericardial fluid as well as the heart “swinging” around inside the pericardial cavity. Cardiac catheterization measures the pressure inside the cardiac chambers—in case of tamponade, the pressure in all four chambers is equal.Treatment of cardiac tamponade in the acute setting is a pericardiocentesis. That’s where a needle is inserted directly into the pericardium to drain the excess pericardial fluid. Following this, the underlying disease has to be monitored and managed.\n",
            "Cardiac tumors are abnormal growths of cells that form a mass in the heart. If the cell growth has the potential to invade and spread to other tissues — a process called metastasis — it’s a malignant tumor, more commonly known as a cancer. If it is not able to invade other tissues, it’s referred to as a benign tumor.Now, the vast majority of tumors of the heart are actually secondary, meaning that a tumor developed somewhere  else in the body, metastasized, and spread to the heart.   Even though these secondary tumors can come from anywhere, they’re most commonly metastases from lung cancer, lymphoma or lymphatic system cancer, breast cancer, leukemia or blood cell cancer, melanoma or skin cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer, and colon cancer, in this order. Cancer most commonly metastasizes through the lymphatic system to the pericardium, the membrane around the heart. When the pericardium is involved, it often leads to pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, and pericardial effusion, an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity. Metastases to the myocardium are less common, but arise more commonly when cancer spreads via the blood. Primary cardiac tumors, on the other hand, are actually extremely rare. The most common type of primary tumors in adults — when they do happen — are myxomas. Myxomas are benign tumors that arise from the mesenchymal connective tissue inside the heart, as opposed to the actual myocytes, or heart cells, because the heart of an adult is fully developed and its cells, or myocytes, are permanent and don’t proliferate.   These masses are gelatinous in consistency, as a result of an abundance of ground substance on histology, and pedunculated, meaning attached to a peduncle, or a stalk of tissue.  With this big mass on a stick in the left atrium, when blood flows through the atrium it can sort of swing around and get close to the mitral valve, which can block blood from flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle through the mitral valve, causing syncopal episodes. Surgical removal of the myxoma is typically curative.The most common primary cardiac tumor in infants and children, as opposed to adults, are rhabdomyomas. Rhabdomyo refers to striated muscle tissue, or cardiac muscle tissue in this case, so rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of the heart that usually affect the ventricles. They are best considered hamartomas rather than a true neoplasm. Hamart means “fault,” so hamartomas are actually the result of an abnormal formation of normal tissue; basically, there was some fault in how the tissue grew. These developmental masses happen frequently in patients that also have tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder that causes these non-cancerous masses to form in various tissues. This is due to mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes, genes that usually suppress tumor growth; therefore, a mutation leads to myocyte overgrowth.  Most rhabdomyomas usually regress spontaneously. However, if they do cause symptoms, such as obstructing a valve or the outflow of blood from the heart, they may be surgically removed.\n",
            "Central anti-adrenergics are a class of medications that’s not very commonly used these days. Their mechanism of action is to target the adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system, and prevent them from effectively releasing the catecholamines: norepinephrine and epinephrine.    So, the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system, so the brain and spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system, which includes all the nerves that connect the central nervous system to the muscles and organs. The peripheral nervous system can be divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movement of our skeletal muscles; and the autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary movement of smooth muscles and glands of our organs.Now, the autonomic nervous system - which includes both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems - is made up of a relay that includes two neurons. We’ll focus on just the sympathetic nervous system. Signals for the autonomic nervous system start in the hypothalamus, at the base of the brain. Hypothalamic neurons have really long axons that carry signals all the way down to the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord nuclei, where they synapse with preganglionic neuron cell bodies. Here, they release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which causes the preganglionic neurons to transmit the signals down their relatively short axon, which exits the central nervous system via the spinal cord. These short nerve fibers reach the nearby sympathetic ganglion, which consists of many postganglionic neuron cell bodies. The postganglionic neurons are also called adrenergic neurons, because they release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is also called noradrenaline; and to a much lesser degree, epinephrine, or adrenaline. These two catecholamines activate the adrenergic receptors on many different organs, which allow the sympathetic nervous system to trigger the fight or flight response that increases the heart rate and blood pressure, as well as slowing digestion. All of this maximizes blood flow to the muscles and brain, and can help you either run away from a threat, or fight it, which is why it’s also called the “fight or flight response.”Alright, so let’s zoom into the synapse between the hypothalamic neurons and the preganglionic neurons, which can be found throughout the brainstem and spinal cord.  The presynaptic terminal contains loads of tiny synaptic vesicles, each of which stores thousands of norepinephrine molecules. But for norepinephrine to be there in the first place, a precursor amino acid, called tyrosine, is taken up by the adrenergic neuron and gets converted to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, or L-DOPA for short, by an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase. Next, L-DOPA is converted by an enzyme called DOPA decarboxylase to dopamine, which is then packaged into the synaptic vesicles. The remaining dopamine will be broken down by a class of enzymes called monoamine oxidases, or MAOs for short. Okay, now once inside the vesicles, dopamine get converted into norepinephrine. And then, whenever the appropriate signal travels down the axon to the axon terminal, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane in order for norepinephrine to get released (or exocytosed) into the synaptic cleft and take action on the adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. Okay, but this release of norepinephrine is controlled through negative feedback inhibition. So when a pre-synaptic nerve terminal is stimulated to release a bunch of norepinephrine in the synapse, some of it will bind to a special type of receptor called an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, located on the presynaptic membrane. These alpha-2 receptors then inhibit further release of norepinephrine into the synapse, so the postsynaptic neuron doesn’t get over stimulated.Alright, so medications that act on adrenergic neurons of the brainstem to inhibit adrenergic signal transmission are called central anti-adrenergics. What these do, is collectively oppose the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. So overall, the heart rate and blood pressure decrease, digestive processes speed up, and the fight-or-flight response gets blocked.Okay, so central anti-adrenergics are divided into alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and a special drug called methyldopa. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla. This decreases the release of  norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, which leads to lower blood pressure. At the same time, alpha-2 receptor agonists, clonidine in particular, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors present in a special region at the front of the brain, called the prefrontal cortex, where they exert the same inhibitory effect on norepinephrine release. Moderating the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain helps tune out irrelevant stimuli and sharpens focus, so it’s useful in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD for short. Now, the main side effect of these medications is that blood pressure may fall too low and cause orthostatic hypotension.  Also, if someone quits taking them too abruptly, blood pressure may climb over the roof and cause severe rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic activity. Other side effects include sedation, fatigue, as well as nausea and gastric upset.Now, another central anti-adrenergic medication is methyldopa. Methyldopa looks like L-DOPA, so much that it fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine. Methyldopamine can’t get broken down by monoamine oxidases, so it builds up and moves into the synaptic vesicles and gets converted to methylnorepinephrine! Methylnorepinephrine then builds up inside the vesicles and pushes the true norepinephrine into the cytoplasm where they get chopped up by monoamine oxidases. So when a signal comes, methylnorepinephrine is released instead. And methylnorepinephrine not only can’t activate adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuron, but it can circle back to act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neuron membrane, leading to further inhibition of norepinephrine release. So, methyldopa can be given to lower blood pressure during pregnancy, since it’s safe for the baby. In general though, it’s not so commonly used due to its several side effects, ranging from mild ones, like drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, and gastric upset, to pretty severe ones like liver toxicity, allergic reactions, and hemolytic reactions or red blood cell breakdown.Now, we want to make a simple and fun mnemonic that’ll help you efficiently memorize and retain all these pharm facts! Okay, so let’s have an iguana driving a Benz, for guanabenz and another iguana is powdering her face, for guanfacine. In the backseat is a clown for clonidine.  And they head down a highway lane, called alpha-2, to remind you that they are alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and there’s a billboard with a giant brain to help you remember they act on the central nervous system. In the middle of the lane, a black cat trapped in a cage is drinking from a cup of cola, which represents the inhibition of catecholamine release. For the indications of these drugs, there’s a large blood pressure cuff sticking out of the trunk to represent hypertension. The clown is jumping up and down to show that clonidine is used to treat ADHD. For the major side effects, let’s use a billboard on the side of the road. So on the sign, there’s a picture of a basketball player getting a rebound, which represents rebound hypertension. And the fans are fainting from excitement to represent orthostatic hypotension. Okay, moving onto the next drug! Further down the alpha-2 highway, there’s a pregnant doberman carrying a slab of meat, for methyldopa, which is safe for use during pregnancy. It’s bullying a black kitty out of its box, to represent how this medication can displace catecholamines from their vesicles. For indications, let’s put a blood pressure cuff around the box for hypertension. Behind the doberman, we have a chewed up liver and some shredded red blood cells, since methyldopa causes liver toxicity and hemolysis.\n",
            "Peripheral presynaptic anti-adrenergics are a class of medication that’s not very commonly used these days. Their mechanism of action is to target the presynaptic adrenergic neurons in the peripheral nervous system, and prevent them from effectively releasing the catecholamines, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.The nervous system is divided into the central nervous system, so the brain and spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system, which includes all the nerves that connect the central nervous system to the muscles and organs. The peripheral nervous system can be divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movement of our skeletal muscles; and the autonomic nervous system, which is further divided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, and controls the involuntary movement of the smooth muscles and glands of our organs.Now, the autonomic nervous system - which includes both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system - is made up of a relay that includes two neurons.

Hypothalamic neurons have really long axons that carry signals all the way down to the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord nuclei, where they synapse with preganglionic neuron cell bodies.

The postganglionic neurons are also called adrenergic neurons because they release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is also called noradrenalin; and to a much lesser degree, epinephrine, or adrenaline. These two catecholamines activate the adrenergic receptors on many different organs, which allow the sympathetic nervous system to trigger the fight or flight response that  increases the heart rate and blood pressure, as well as slowing digestion. All of this maximizes blood flow to the muscles and brain, and can help you either run away from a threat, or fight it, which is why it’s also called the fight or flight response.Now, let’s zoom into an adrenergic synapse. The presynaptic terminal contains loads of tiny synaptic vesicles, each of which stores thousands of norepinephrine molecules. But for norepinephrine to be there in the first place, a precursor amino acid, called tyrosine, is taken up by the adrenergic neuron and gets converted to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, or L-DOPA for short, by an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase. Next, L-DOPA is converted to dopamine, which is then packaged into the synaptic vesicles with the help of a transporter, called Vesicular Monoamine Transporter, or VMAT for short. The remaining dopamine will be broken down by a class of enzymes called monoamine oxidases, or MAOs for short. Okay, now once inside the vesicles, dopamine get converted by dopamine β-hydroxylase into norepinephrine. And then, whenever the appropriate signal travels down the axon to the axon terminal, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane in order for norepinephrine to get released (or exocytosed), into the synaptic cleft and take action on the adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. Now, each of these presynaptic neurons has small reuptake proteins, called Norepinephrine Transporters, or NETs for short, which pump norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft back into presynaptic neurons. Once inside the neuron, with the help of Vesicular Monoamine Transporter, or VMAT, norepinephrine gets packaged into pre-existing vesicles, waiting to be released once more. Just like dopamine, any bit of norepinephrine that’s left behind in the cytoplasm will be broken down by monoamine oxidases or MAOs. Alright, so medications that act on peripheral presynaptic adrenergic neurons to inhibit adrenergic signal transmission are called peripheral presynaptic anti-adrenergics. What these do, is collectively oppose the effects of the sympathetic nervous system - so, overall, heart rate and blood pressure decrease, digestion speeds up and the fight-or-flight response gets blocked. Okay, so peripheral presynaptic anti-adrenergics are further subdivided into those affecting norepinephrine synthesis, norepinephrine storage, and norepinephrine release. Now, there are inhibitors of norepinephrine synthesis, which include alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or metyrosine. Metyrosine looks like tyrosine, and it can bind to and inhibit the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. This means less tyrosine gets converted to L-DOPA, so, down the road, less norepinephrine is produced, and less gets released into the synaptic cleft. Metyrosine can be given to lower the blood pressure in individuals with pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla, which secretes too much catecholamines, causing extreme peaks of high blood pressure, or hypertension. The main side effect, though, is that blood pressure may fall too low, causing hypotension. Now, norepinephrine storage is mainly inhibited by another medication called reserpine. Reserpine’s job is to block the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter, or VMAT. What this means is that dopamine is prevented from getting stored into the synaptic vesicles and turning into norepinephrine. At the same time, recirculated norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft cannot get repackaged into the synaptic vesicles. Instead, both dopamine and norepinephrine build up in the cytoplasm, where they get chopped up by monoamine oxidases, or MAOs. The end result is a decrease in both norepinephrine and dopamine. This makes reserpine effective in controlling high blood pressure. However, it’s almost never used today, due to its poor absorption, slow metabolism, and most importantly, its long-term side effects on the central nervous system, where it causes the same depletion of dopamine and norepinephrine. This results in depression, drowsiness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Alright, now norepinephrine release is directly inhibited by guanethidine. Guanethidine gets gobbled up by the presynaptic terminal through norepinephrine transporters, so it directly competes with norepinephrine during its reuptake. So essentially, more norepinephrine remains active in the synaptic cleft, causing a transient increase in adrenergic signals, and thus, an increase in blood pressure. As guanethidine enters the presynaptic nerve, it accumulates in the synaptic vesicles, where it displaces norepinephrine. And soon enough, norepinephrine stores get depleted. At the same time, guanethidine blocks the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, preventing norepinephrine release into the synaptic cleft. All this leads to less stimulation of the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors, which can be useful in terms of lowering the blood pressure. However, just like reserpine, guanethidine is almost obsolete today, due to its poor absorption, slow metabolism, and most importantly, its initial hypertensive effect. Now, we want to make a simple and fun mnemonic that’ll help you efficiently memorize and retain all these pharm facts! Okay, so let’s have a toy factory with three workers. The first worker is building a toy black cat holding a cola can, for catecholamine synthesis. He’s about to be attacked by a tyrannosaurus holding a slab of meat, for metyrosine. It’s also snapping at a bird that’s half-crow and half-phoenix, since it’s used to treat hypertension in pheochromocytoma.  The next worker represents storage, so he’s packing boxes. Since the medications in this class affect both catecholamines and dopamine, let’s put a cola cat and a doberman doll in the box. He’s about to be attacked by a robot serpent, for reserpine. The robot serpent has a biological brain on its head to help you remember this medication is very active in the central nervous system, and could cause side effects like depression, so let’s have the robot serpent cry big sad tears. Finally, the last worker is pushing a cart full of cola cats out of the factory, which represents catecholamine release. Waiting for him is an iguana, who’s ready to have him for dinner, which represents guanethidine. Let’s put a pumped up blood pressure cuff on his tail, so you remember that this drug could initially worsen hypertension as a side effect. There’s also a worker who passed out from orthostatic hypotension in the middle of the factory, since all 3 groups of medications can cause this as a side effect.  Due to the unsafe condition of the factory, many of the non-essential workers, like the box packer and the cart pusher, eventually quit, so those medications filling those roles like reserpine and guanethidine are rarely used.\n"

              "\"Laminar means smooth, and so laminar blood flow is blood that’s flowing smoothly through the vessels. Turbulent flow, on the other hand, is when the blood’s not flowing smoothly, and we can figure out if blood is likely to be laminar or turbulent by finding its Reynolds number or Re, which is named after Osborne Reynolds, a Victorian scientist who not only studied fluid dynamics, but is a man that knows how to rock a beard and bowtie.If everything’s moving like it should and the blood flow is laminar, the linear velocity of the blood  -- how fast it’s moving in a straight line -- is greatest in the center of the blood vessel, and lowest near the walls of the vessel, dropping to zero at the wall. Sometimes, though, blood flow is disrupted, like if it has to pass by a crusty old atherosclerotic plaque along the wall, which reduces the diameter of the blood vessel at that point and causes turbulence. There are a number of factors help predict turbulence, they include the density of the blood, usually denoted by the greek letter rho, the viscosity denoted by the greek letter nu. You can kind of think of a fluid’s viscosity as it’s thickness, like for example the viscosity of honey is greater than that of water. Alright, then there’s velocity of blood flow (v), and the diameter of the blood vessel (d)These values can all be used to come up with a single value—the reynold’s number, often denoted Re, and the equation looks like this: NR = pdv/Generally speaking, if the Reynolds number is low - below 2000, then blood flow will be laminar - think “low” and “laminar”, and if the Reynolds number is above 3000 it’ll be turbulent. A Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 is somewhere in between. As a real-life example, a person with anemia has a low red blood cell count, and in general has a lower hematocrit, the ratio of red blood cells to total blood volume. This essentially means the blood’s less thick or viscous, which means based on our equation, if viscosity decreases, reynolds number increases. Also, these individuals often have an increased cardiac output, which means increased blood velocity and therefore increased reynolds number.Another example would be a person with a thrombus, or blood clot, which just like the atherosclerotic plaque would narrow or decrease the diameter of the blood vessel...now, at first glance this seems a little weird eh? But it turns out that blood velocity also depends on the diameter of the vessel, by the equation velocity equals flow rate over area, which after subbing for the area of the blood vessel, is 4Q over pi d^2, so plugging that in for velocity, we see that as diameter decreases, reynolds number increases!Now a related concept is shear. Now, remember how the velocity of the blood depended on whether it was in the center or near the walls? Where it’s fastest in the middle and really slow near the walls, in fact at the molecular level, just outside the walls, water molecules are just sort of loitering around not moving! If we freeze it and plot these velocities, we’ll notice that this difference in velocity is parabolic, meaning that as you move away from the walls, velocity at first jumps up pretty quick, but as you near the middle, the change in velocity is pretty low. This difference in relative velocities is the shear! So if we wanted to plot shear, near the wall where velocity’s changing the most, shear’s actually the highest, and in the middle shear is very low and actually drops to zero.Shear goes hand-in-hand with viscosity, because the higher the shear, the lower the viscosity of the blood. This is because shear helps to pull the elements in the blood apart decreasing it's stickiness, or viscosity, making blood less viscous at the vessel walls and more viscous in the middle of the vessel.Now, let’s say all the blood’s somehow moving at the same velocity. Well in that case, if you plot it out, there’s no change in velocity across the blood vessel, and that makes plotting shear pretty easy...since there’s no change in velocity there’s no shear, and likewise this fluid isn’t viscous!\""

The nucleus of an atom contains a large amount of positive charge, or protons, which repel each other. This force keeps the nucleus stable, even though it is made up of positively charged particles. Nuclear reactions occur when two atoms collide and exchange particles, such as protons or neutrons. These reactions can release energy in the form of light or heat, and they power everything from stars to nuclear reactors. However, nuclear reactions also have the potential to be dangerous, as seen in events like nuclear bombs or accidents at nuclear power plants.'"

              "{0: {0: ['The circulatory system is also called the cardiovascular system, where “cardi” refers to the heart, and “vascular” refers to the blood vessels. So, these are the two key parts: the heart, which pumps blood, and the blood vessels, which carry blood to the body and return it back to the heart again. Ultimately, this is how nutrients like O2, or oxygen, get pushed out to the organs and tissues that need it, and how waste like CO2, or carbon dioxide, which is the main byproduct of cellular respiration, gets removed.The heart is about the size of a person’s fist, which makes sense: a bigger person has a bigger fist and, therefore, a bigger heart.And it’s shaped like a cone, and sits slightly shifted over to the left side, in the mediastinum, which is the middle of the chest cavity, or thorax.It sits on top of the diaphragm, which is the main muscle that helps with breathing, behind the sternum, or breastbone, in front of the vertebral column, squished in between the two lungs, and protected by the ribs.   If you look more closely, you can see that the heart sits inside a sac of fluid that has two walls, called the serous pericardium. The outer layer is called the parietal layer. It gets stuck tightly to another layer called the fibrous pericardium, which is made of tough, dense connective tissue, which holds the heart in place and prevents it from overfilling with blood. The inner layer is called the visceral layer, and it gets stuck tightly to the heart itself, forming the epicardium, or the outer layer of the heart. The cells of the serous pericardium, both the parietal and visceral layer -- secrete a protein-rich fluid that fills the space between those layers and serves as a lubricant for the heart, allowing it to move around a bit with each heartbeat without feeling too much friction. So, moving from the outside to the inside of the heart, after the epicardium, there’s the myocardium, which is the muscular middle layer. This forms the bulk of the heart tissue because those cardiac muscle cells contract and pump blood. In addition to cardiac muscle cells, there are crisscrossing connective tissue fibers, which are made of collagen, that together form the fibrous cardiac skeleton, which helps supports the muscle tissue. The myocardium also has dedicated blood vessels - called coronary vessels - which lay on the outside of the heart and then penetrate into the myocardium to bring blood to that layer because it needs a lot of energy to pump blood. Finally, there’s the innermost layer of the heart, called the endocardium, which is made of a relatively thin layer of endothelium, which is the same layer of cells that line the blood vessels. This endocardium lines the heart chambers and heart valves.  All right, so on the right side of the heart, deoxygenated blood enters either through the top, through a blood vessel called the superior vena cava, or the bottom, through another blood vessel called the inferior vena cava, in the right atrium, where “atrium” means “entryway.”. Both vena cavas are veins, which bring blood towards the heart. There’s also a tiny third opening into the right atrium called the coronary sinus, which collects blood from coronary vessels returning from the myocardium. Now, all of that blood then goes through the first of two atrioventricular valves that separate the atria from the ventricles. This one is called the tricuspid valve, and it allows blood into the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three little flaps or ‘cusps’, and each cusp looks kind of like a parachute because it has tiny little strings called chordae tendinae coming off of it that tether the cusp to a small muscle called a papillary muscle. When the heart contracts, that papillary muscle keeps the chordae tendinae taut, and both of these help to prevent regurgitation of blood back into the atrium, allowing it to only flow out next valve.That being said, that contraction pumps the blood out the pulmonary valve which like the tricuspid valve has three cusps and also prevents blood from going backwards - but unlike the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve doesn’t have any of those chordae tendinae. Once it’s past the pulmonary valve, the blood goes into the pulmonary arteries which carry the blood away from the heart to the left and right lung. Just remember that arteries start with “a” and carry blood “away” from the heart. The blood goes from the pulmonary artery into a pulmonary arteriole, which is a bit smaller, and finally into a capillary, which is the smallest. In the lungs, the capillary lines up alongside a small sack of air called an alveolus - and when you have a lot of them they’re called alveoli. Up until now the blood has been loaded with carbon dioxide, which makes the blood look dark red rather than blue, which is how it’s usually drawn, and how we’ll still draw it to stay consistent. Now, at this point in the journey, the carbon dioxide moves from the capillary to the alveolus and oxygen moves from the alveolus to the capillary, giving the blood that nice bright red color.   Now, in the blood, each red blood cell has millions of hemoglobin proteins, and each of these hemoglobins can bind to four oxygen molecules, so each red blood cell can carry millions of oxygen molecules when fully loaded! The oxygen-rich blood moves into a venule and then eventually into a pulmonary vein that dumps the blood into the left atrium. This trip -- from the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and back to the left atrium of the heart -- is called the pulmonary circulation.  After entering the left atrium, the blood goes through the second atrioventricular valve, called the mitral valve, into the left ventricle. The mitral valve has only two cusps or leaflets, one in front called the anterior leaflet that’s a little smaller and one behind it called the posterior leaflet. Both of these have chordae tendinae coming off of them that tether the valve to papillary muscles in the left ventricle. Similar to the right side of the heart, when it contracts, this prevents blood from going backwards.   Finally, blood in the left ventricle gets pumped out through the aortic valve, which normally has three cusps, out to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. Just like in the lungs, the aorta branches into arterioles which are smaller arteries and finally into capillaries which are the smallest, and at that point they’re at the organs and tissues. In the organs, the red blood cells line up alongside tissue cells and drop off oxygen and pick up carbon dioxide, basically the reverse of what happened with the alveolus in the lung. Loaded up with carbon dioxide, the blood turns that dark red color again, shown as blue, and starts the return journey to the heart by going into small venules and then larger veins. Now, the lower half of the body drains into the inferior vena cava, and the upper half drains into the superior vena cava, both of which dump blood back into the right atrium.   So this trip -- from the left ventricle of the heart to the body and back to the right atrium of the heart -- is called the systemic circulation. Now, relative to the pulmonary circulation, the systemic has a lot more blood vessels, which means there’s about a 5 times greater resistance to blood flow, which essentially meaning it’s a lot harder to pump blood through, even though it’s the same amount of blood being pumped as the pulmonary side. Because of this difference, the left ventricle needs to be stronger, and so the muscular layer of the left ventricle wall - or its myocardium - is three times thicker than the right ventricle’s myocardium.   Okay so let’s talk a little bit about that pumping. Every heartbeat, sounds something like, “lub dub, lub dub, lub dub.” So the first heart sound - “lub”, is called S1, and the noise comes from the tricuspid and mitral valves snapping shut when the left and right ventricles contract which happens at about the same time. Right after the S1 sound, the aortic valve and pulmonic valve open up, allowing blood to get pushed out to the body, and this period of time is called systole. The second heart sound - “dub”, is called S2, and the noise comes from the aortic and pulmonic valves snapping shut to prevent blood from flowing backwards after it leaves the ventricles - effectively ending systole. Right after the S2 sound, the tricuspid and mitral valves open back up, allowing blood to fill up the ventricles again, and this period of time is called diastole. That’s it, each heartbeat can be broken into systole and diastole. So a systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the ventricles are squeezing out blood under high pressure, and diastolic blood pressure is when the ventricles are filling up with more blood, so it’s going to be slightly lower pressure.   Alright so if we simplify this guy a bit, then the amount of blood that is pumped out by either ventricle over a period of time is called the cardiac output. And the rate at which the veins return blood back to the atria is called venous return -- pretty easy to remember, right? Since the circulatory system is a closed loop, cardiac output and venous are equal.   Okay so let’s use some numbers to make this a little more concrete. Let’s say that about 70ml is ejected per squeeze, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute or 70 squeezes per minute. Then 70 x 70 is 4900ml per minute, which in liters is 4.9 L per minute. Meaning this heart’s pumping abut 4.9 L per minute.  Now, in an average adult there’s about 5 L of blood total in the body, which just to be clear is different from the cardiac output we just found, which was the amount pumped per minute. Now, taking this total volume, 10% of that (or about 0.5 ml) is in the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins which make up the pulmonic circulation, and 5% (or .25L) is in one of the four chambers of the heart itself.   Another 15% (or 750 ml) is in the systemic arteries, travelling away from the heart, 5% (or 250 ml) is in the systemic capillaries, and the remaining 65% (or 3.25 L) is in the systemic veins returning to the heart. Now, in terms of where all of that systemic arterial blood goes - about 15% goes to the brain, 5% nourishes the heart itself, 25% goes to the kidneys, another 25% goes to the gastrointestinal organs, yet another 25% goes to the skeletal muscles, and the the last 5% goes to the skin. These numbers can change, for example during exercise, but it gives you a general sense of things.   Alright so that was the systemic arterial blood, but you’ll notice that there’s a lot more blood in the systemic veins, with that being said, arteries are generally lower volume while also being under much higher pressure. In contrast, veins are high volume, low pressure vessels. This explains why arteries and veins have different structures. For example, veins often have valves to help fight gravity and keep blood flowing in one direction back to the heart, whereas arteries don’t need these valves because they’re under higher pressure.  If we take a closer look at blood vessels, they have three layers, also called “tunics,” or coverings, that surround the vessel lumen, which is the hollow part of the vessel that contains the blood. The innermost tunic is the tunica intima, which includes the endothelial cells which create a slick surface that minimizes friction for blood moving through. Next, there’s the tunica media, or middle tunic, which is mostly made of smooth muscle cells and of sheets of elastin protein. Both the cells of the tunica intima and tunica media generally get the nutrients they need from the blood in the lumen. Finally, there’s the tunica externa, or outside tunic, which is made up of loosely woven fibers of collagen protein that protect and reinforce the blood vessel and anchor it in place. The tunica externa also has nerve fibers, lymphatic vessels, and, in the biggest vessels, the protein elastin. To make things really wild, some huge vessels have a tunica externa that is so thick that it needs its own blood supply! So there are tiny blood vessels, called the vasa vasorum, which means “vessels of the vessels,” that creep along the tunica externa to bring nutrients to that layer of the blood vessel wall.  So largest arteries closest to the heart, which are the aorta, its main branches, and the pulmonary arteries -- have so much elastin in their tunica externa and media that they’re called the elastic arteries. These guys are really stretchy -- kinda like spandex -- and this is what allows these arteries to keep their shape as well as absorb and even out the systolic and diastolic pressures. These arteries eventually branch into the arterioles, the smallest of the arteries. In the arterioles, the tunica media is bulky, and can contract in response to hormones and the autonomic nervous system, which is called vasoconstriction, where the lumen gets a lot smaller, which decreases the blood to a capillary bed and ultimately organ or tissue. Also these vessels can relax, or vasodilate and the lumen’s diameter increases, which allows more blood flow. This process can also help with temperature control, or thermoregulation, because blood carries a lot of heat and when it gets near the surface of the skin, more of that heat is lost. So with vasodilation of arterioles, more heat’s lost, which therefore helps to lower body temperature, likewise if you wanted to raise body temperature, vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, which means less heat gets lost through the surface of the skin.  Finally, the capillary walls are generally only one cell thick - just the tunica intima layer, with some larger vessels that also have a subendothelium basement membrane layer, which is a layer of protein just outside of the endothelial cells that provides extra support. In addition to allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to flow back and forth, capillaries are also where nutrients like glucose can get delivered, and where fluid can move out of the blood vessel and into the interstitial space - which is the space between the blood vessels and cells. Water-soluble substances, like ions, cross the capillary wall either through water-filled spaces, called clefts, between the endothelial cells, or through large pores in the walls of fenestrated capillaries. Meanwhile, lipid-, or fat-soluble, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can dissolve and then diffuse across the endothelial cell membranes.   On the other end of the capillary bed, there’s a venule, and the arteriole and venule are usually directly connected by a vessel called the metarteriole.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, the pulmonary circulation goes from the right ventricle which delivers blood to the lungs, which then sends fresh oxygenated blood to the left atrium, at which point it enters the systemic circulation starting with the left ventricle which pumps blood to the body, and then deoxygenated blood comes back to the right atrium and it starts all over again!

              "  1: ['“Lymph” means “clear water” in Latin, and it describes the fluid that flows through the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes which make up the lymphatic system. The three major roles of the lymphatic system - the reason we need it in the first place - are that it returns fluid from the tissues back to the heart, it helps large molecules like hormones and lipids enter the blood, and it helps with immune surveillance to keep infections from running amok.So, let’s take a closer look at lymph and where it comes from. The blood in the arteries is under a lot of pressure because it needs to reach every little nook and cranny of the body. The arteries branch out into narrower and narrower arteries, and then arterioles, and finally gets to the capillaries - which have walls that are only one cell thick and are slightly porous. Red blood cells are too big to fit through capillary pores, but small proteins like albumin and fluid can make it through. Every day 20 liters of fluid water and protein - seep out of the capillaries and becomes part of the interstitial fluid between cells. About 17 liters gets quickly reabsorbed right back into the capillaries,but that leaves 3 liters of fluid behind in the tissues each day. This 3 liters of fluid needs to find a way back into the blood so that the body’s interstitial fluid volume and blood volume both stay constant over time. That’s where the lymphatic vessels, or lymphatics, come in: they collect excess interstitial fluid and return it to the blood. Once the interstitial fluid is in the lymphatic vessels, it’s called lymph. Now - you may be wondering how there can be 20 liters of fluid seeping out each day if the blood volume is only 5 liters, but remember that the 5 liters is constantly in motion and that it gets recycled over and over in a single day. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system isn’t a closed loop because fluid and proteins make their way into the microscopic lymphatic capillaries, and all of the collected lymph is dumped into the veins. Lymphatic capillaries are the smallest lymphatic vessels, and they’re located throughout the interstitial space. Lymphatic capillaries are extremely permeable because their walls are made of endothelial cells that only loosely overlap, forming one-way minivalves. These endothelial cells are anchored to structures in the interstitial space by collagen filaments, which allows the lymphatic capillaries to remain flexible but retain their overall shape. When the pressure in the interstitial space is greater than the pressure in the lymphatic capillary, the endothelial minivalves open up, allowing fluid to enter. When the pressure in the interstitial space is less than the pressure in the lymphatic capillary, the endothelial minivalves are pushed shut, keeping the lymph inside. Once the lymph is inside the lymphatic capillaries, it travels through bigger and thicker-walled vessels, then trunks, and then ducts. There’s no pump pushing the lymph through the lymphatic system; instead, smooth muscle in the lymph vessels reacts to the pulsing of nearby arteries by squeezing to get things started, and then the squeezing of skeletal muscles, which normally contract throughout the day, exert external pressure to keep the lymph moving along eventually reaching a nearby lymphatic trunk. To keep the lymph from sliding backwards, the lymphatic vessels have valves just like the veins. The lymphatic trunks are named after the regions of the body that they drain the lymph from: two lumbar trunks, two bronchomediastinal trunks, two subclavian trunks, and two jugular trunks, as well as one intestinal trunk. From there, the lymph is delivered to either the right lymphatic duct which collects lymph from the right arm and the right side of the head and chest, or the thoracic duct, which is much bigger and collects lymph from the rest of the body. The right lymphatic duct dumps lymph into the junction of the right jugular vein and the right subclavian vein, and the thoracic duct dumps lymph into the same junction on the left side of the body. That particular spot is perfect because it’s where the pressure is very low, making it much easier for the lymph to flow in. The lymphatic system has key advantages: for example it can pick up larger molecules, like hormones, that are too large to get into the capillaries, and get them into the bloodstream. The lymphatic system can also help get nutrients to the tissues. For example, during a meal, fatty acids get packaged into balls of fat called chylomicrons by the small intestine. But like the hormones, these are too large to move across capillaries. Instead, the chylomicrons go into special lymphatic vessels called lacteals, which get their name from the fact that the lymph that flows through them looks like milk. The chylomicrons slowly make their way up into the thoracic duct and get dumped into the venous blood. The lymphatic system also plays an important role in immune function. Lymphoid organs remove foreign material from the lymph to keep it from entering the bloodstream, and act as lookout points for the body’s immune defenses. Some lymphoid organs are in the form of diffuse lymphoid tissue, where they are just a loose arrangement of lymphoid cells and protein, this is typical in the lining of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. Another type of lymphoid organ are lymph nodes, which are tightly packed balls of lymphoid cells and protein. Hundreds of lymph nodes cluster along the lymph vessels, each one a few millimeters to about 1–2 cm in size. When they’re concentrated along the lymph trunks, you can feel them, especially in the neck, armpit, and groin. They can also be found in the intestinal wall, where they’re called Peyer’s patches. When an infection gets into the tissue, it can slip into a lymphatic capillary and move into a lymphatic vessel. Unfiltered lymph fluid drains into a nearby lymph node where any pathogen or piece of pathogen is quickly detected by a dendritic cell - a type of antigen-presenting cell that serves up pieces of anything in destroys to other immune cells. In the lymph nodes, dendritic cells continuously sample the lymph and present antigens that they come across to the B cells which are a type of lymphocyte that can make antibodies. B cells are designed to only react to foreign antigens, and if the dendritic cell presents something foreign, the B cell turns into a plasma cells and starting cranking out antibodies which flow into the lymph exiting the lymph node. There are also circulating T cells, which are another type of lymphocyte that move between the lymph nodes, lymph, and blood on the lookout for pathogens and infected or abnormal cells that have been tagged by antibodies.Another lymphoid organ is the spleen, which is about the size of a fist, and sits on the left side of the body below the diaphragm and on top of the stomach. The spleen has both white pulp and red pulp. The white pulp is where antibody-coated bacteria are filtered out of circulation and antibodies are generated by B cells. In a sense, the white pulp of the spleen is like a giant lymph node, although unlike a lymph node which receives unfiltered lymphatic fluid, the spleen receives blood. The red pulp of the spleen is where old and defective blood cells are destroyed and their parts - the hemoglobin, the heme chain, and the iron - are either broken down or recycled. The spleen is also a helpful in that it keeps a red blood cells and platelets available in case they are suddenly needed by the body. An organ that’s got your back in an emergency.Another lymphoid organ is the thymus, which is in the upper part of the chest - just below where a necklace might lie. The thymus is most active in the neonatal period and pre-adolescent years, and then slowly atrophies and gets replaced by fat after puberty. The thymus is involved in the development of T cells - making sure that any T cells that react to self-antigens, antigens that are normally found in the body, are promptly destroyed. A final set of lymphoid organs worth mentioning are the tonsils, which include the adenoid, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils. Together they form a ring of lymphoid tissue around the throat, and their main job is to trap pathogens from the food you eat and air you inhale. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: the lymphatic system refers to the one-way network of lymphatic vessels that allows lymph, a clear fluid that’s squeezed out of the blood, to transport nutrients to the cells and act as a method of waste removal. Lymph is cleansed at lymph nodes throughout the lymphatic system, which play an important role in immune function.'],\n",
              "  2: ['Pressure is a force over an area, so with blood pressure, we’re measuring the force that the blood exerts on the surface area of the walls of the blood vessels. Differences in blood pressure throughout the body keep blood flowing from high-pressure areas, like the arteries, to low-pressure areas, like the veins. When we say “blood flow,” we’re referring to the volume of blood that flows through a vessel or an organ over some period of time. Now, the amount of blood flow from one end of a blood vessel to another is affected by the blood pressure, and by the resistance, which comes from the vessels themselves. Vasoconstriction, where the vessels constrict, decreases blood flow, and vasodilation, where the blood vessels expand, increases blood flow.   Now, blood flow is not the same thing as the velocity of blood. Blood flow is the volume of blood that moves by a point over some period of time. So let’s say this chunk of blood has a volume of 83 cm^3, and it took 1 second for this much to flow past the blue circle—this is the blood flow, represented by the variable capital Q.   Now, velocity on the other hand, is the distance traveled in a certain amount of time. So maybe in the same one second, a red blood cell at the very edge here traveled a distance of 27 cm, then it’d be moving 27 cm/s, represented by lowercase v. Even though these aren’t equal, they are related, and the last piece is area, specifically the cross-sectional area of the blood vessel, which in reality is the same as the blood cross section like this. So, based on units, since area’s going to be expressed in cm^2, we see that flow rate equals area times velocity! Alright, so for example, let’s say we want to calculate blood velocity, and we have a person’s cardiac output of 5L/min, which is average for an adult, and the diameter of their aorta, which is 2cm.  First off, using the equation for the area of a circle, (D/2)^2 x pi, we get (2 / 2)^2 x pi = 3.14 cm^2. Next, since cardiac output is the same as blood flow, we just need to convert this L/min to cubic cm per second, so there are 1000 cubic cm in a L, and 60 seconds in a minute, so multiplying those out we get 83 cubic cm per second. Then, rearranging our little formula, velocity equals flow rate divided by area, and we get about 26 cm per second! Which is also about 1 km / hr!  Going back to blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance, that relationship can be written out mathematically as well. So, to start, you have an initial, higher pressure at one end, and a final, lower pressure at the other. The difference between these, or the initial minus the final pressure, sometimes expressed as delta P, equals blood flow through that vessel multiplied by resistance. This can be also written as Q equals change in pressure over resistance. So, for example, let’s say the the blood vessel narrows, which increases the resistance, in order to keep the flow of blood to organs the same, the pressure difference has to increase, and this is typically what happens. This equation might look familiar to a similar equation, where change in voltage V equals current I times resistance R, also known as ohm’s law!   Okay, let’s talk about pressure. Blood pressure is usually highest in a large artery like the brachial artery, which is where blood pressure is usually measured, That’s because at that point the blood still needs to be able to push through the smaller arterioles and capillaries, which means lots of resistance. In an average adult, blood pressure is about 120/80 mmHg or millimeters of mercury. That might look like a fraction, but it’s not. The first number, 120, is the systolic pressure, which is the force that the blood exerts on the walls of the arteries during systole, when the heart contracts to pump blood through the body, and the second number, 80, is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure on the walls of the arteries during diastole, when the heart relaxes and refills with blood between heartbeats. That’s why the first number is bigger: the arteries are under more pressure when there’s more force from the heart pushing the blood.  The mean arterial pressure, or MAP, is the average pressure on the arteries during a complete cardiac cycle, including the systolic and diastolic pressures. It can be calculated a couple ways. The first is the quickest: we assume that about ⅓ of the cardiac cycle is spent in systole and about ⅔ of the cardiac cycle is spent in diastole and say that the MAP = ⅓ (systolic blood pressure) + ⅔ (diastolic blood pressure). Another measuremnt is the pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure, so in our example, it would be 120 - 80 or 40 mm Hg. So another way to figure it out is to say that MAP = ⅓ (pulse pressure) + diastolic pressure, which is exactly the same thing, but just written differently.   Now, a completely different way to think about MAP is by using the relationship between blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance. Let’s go back to our big artery, say this time it’s the aorta, the biggest of the arteries coming right from the heart itself. That artery goes to arterioles and capillaries, representing the whole human body, and then the venous blood returns to the right atrium of the heart. So in this zoomed out view, the initial pressure here is pressure in the arteries, in other words—the mean arterial pressure, and the final pressure over here is we have the central venous pressure, or CVP, in the vena cavae right before they enter the right atrium.   Looking back at our equation, Pi - Pf = Q x R, blood flow is the total blood flow through all of the blood vessels and organs, which is called the cardiac output and is measured in L/min. Pi is MAP and Pf is CVP, and finally, the combined resistance of all of the blood vessels of systemic circulation would be the systemic vascular resistance, called SVR,. So the equation is MAP - CVP = CO x SVR. CVP is usually a small number, so it’s usually ignored and the equation is simplified to MAP = CO x SVR. Based on this relationship, you can see why for example, an increase in resistance, which is mostly caused by arteriole vasoconstriction, will cause the blood pressure to rise.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: blood pressure refers to the force the blood exerts on the blood vessels, blood flow refers to the volume of blood that flows through the blood vessels, an organ, or the entire body, over a certain amount of time, and resistance refers to the physical and mechanical pushback the blood gets from things like vasoconstriction.

              "  3: ['When we talk about pressures in the cardiovascular system, we’re talking about blood pressure. Pressures in different parts of the cardiovascular system aren’t equal and these differences in pressures keep the blood moving from high pressure areas leaving the heart like the arteries to low pressure areas like the veins. Actually, the pressure curve looks a little more like this, and fluctuates in the arteries depending on part of the cardiac cycle it’s in, with these peaks being systole, and these low points being diastole -That being said, this original line is the average of these fluctuations, or the mean arterial pressure. Now, since systole takes up about a third of a single cardiac cycle, and diastole takes up the remaining 2/3 of the cycle, we can calculate the mean arterial pressure at any time by the equation:                                MAP = (⅓) SBP + (⅔) DBPWhich after distributing we get:                                MAP = DBP + (⅓) PPNow, looking at these fluctuations on the arterial side, there’s a couple important things to notice. First of all, on the downswing of the curve, there’s a sharp sharp pressure drop followed by a rise again forming what’s called the dicrotic notch or incisura. As blood is ejected out into the aorta, pressure rises quickly, and then as a tiny amount of blood flows back into the ventricle, and causes the valve to snap shut and the pressure to fall. That snapping shut of the valve causes it to recoil back, which causes a brief increase in pressure of aorta, and then finally the pressure falls as the aorta settles and the heart relaxes.A second interesting thing to notice is that the pulse pressure in the large arteries downstream of the aorta is larger than those in the aorta themselves!That’s because the pressure from blood travels a bit faster than blood itself. To understand that idea - think of the molecules and cells in the blood like Newton’s cradle, and while they move together, they bump into each other and transmit that pressure wave faster than the group can move as a whole, meaning that the pressure wave actually increases the pressure downstream. Also, the pressure waves bounce off the branch points in the arteries, which causes them to reflect back and increase the pressure in the arteries even more.Alright, so it should seem a little weird that both systolic pressure and pulse pressure are higher in the downstream arteries, since we know that blood wants to move from a high pressure area to a low pressure area, but one thing to remember is that in the large arteries the diastolic pressure is lower, and remember that it’s the mean arterial pressure that drives blood flow, which this is mostly affected by diastolic pressure, which is highest in the aorta. As an example, let’s say the aorta’s SBP is 115 and DBP is 85, meaning PP is 30. That said, the MAP is 95 mmHg. Now, if the large arteries’ SBP is 120 and DBP is 80, with a PP of 40, the MAP ends up being 93, which is lower than in the aorta like we’d expect! Okay, so as we move out from the arterial tree, the pressure gets lower and lower as the arteries branch out into smaller and smaller arteries and then arterioles and then capillaries. As the blood move across the arterioles the pressure falls from about 80 mmHg to 30 mmHg. As the vessels branch into smaller and smaller arterioles, resistance goes up, and since resistance goes up, and according to the equation flow rate equals change in pressure or pressure initial minus pressure final, divided by resistance, with increased resistance, the pressure final or downstream pressure must decreases, which increases the change in pressure and keeps flow rate constant. Across the capillaries, the pressure drops from 30 mmHg down to about 10 mmHg. So the pressure drop is greater across the arterioles then the capillaries, even though capillaries are even smaller, which means even more resistance. The pressure drop is less, though, because there are so many capillaries that run in parallel to one another, that it helps to reduce total resistance, since total resistance for vessels in parallel is less than the resistance in any individual vessel. After the capillaries, blood goes into the venules and then the larger veins. At this point, the pressure drops aren’t great because the blood vessels have a larger and larger radius and have a high compliance and can expand to hold more blood.Finally blood makes it to the vena cavae, and pressure is roughly 4 mmHg and right atrial pressure is around 2 mmHg. Even though there are only small differences in pressure, it’s enough to move blood back to the heart, even when it’s going against gravity. Various clinical situations can cause pressures in the system to go up or down, and that affects all of the downstream pressures as well. As an example, let’s take a closer look at the normal aortic pressure curve, and then two situations that often alter aortic pressures. The first is arteriosclerosis, which is a chronic condition where the arteries become stiff and less compliant, a bit like a rubber hose turning into a lead pipe over time. The baseline diastolic pressure usually doesn’t change, but the extra volume of blood that exerts pressure on the walls during systole, results in enormous increases in systolic pressure because the walls are so stiff. The high systolic pressure with the unchanged diastolic pressure means that there is also an increased pulse pressure and therefore an increased mean arterial pressure. The second example is aortic stenosis - a narrowing of the aortic valve which increases it’s resistance. With increased resistance, the change in pressure must increase, which means there’s a decrease in pressure after the valve. The diastolic pressure remains unchanged, but there’s a decrease systolic pressure, decreased pulse pressure, and decreased mean arterial pressure. Alright, so this whole bit we just talked about is the systemic circulation, but once the blood gets the right atrium it enters the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation. So here in the pulmonary arteries, the pressure is 25 mm Hg during systole and 8 mm Hg during diastole, which means that the mean arterial pressure in the pulmonary artery is 25 (⅓) + 8 (⅔) = 14 mm Hg. That pressure drops to 10 mm Hg in the capillaries, to 8 mm Hg in the pulmonary vein, then to 2-5 mm Hg in the left atrium. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: vascular pressures drive blood flow because the blood always wants to move from high pressure to lower pressure. The reason that blood pressure falls as the blood moves away from the heart is that blood has to get through many blood vessels, each of which typically offers a bit of resistance. There are pulsations -- pressure fluctuations -- in the aorta, that get bigger in the downstream arteries and then disappear in the arterioles, but mean arterial pressure always falls as the blood goes downstream.

              "  4: [\"Laminar means smooth, and so laminar blood flow is blood that’s flowing smoothly through the vessels. Turbulent flow, on the other hand, is when the blood’s not flowing smoothly, and we can figure out if blood is likely to be laminar or turbulent by finding its Reynolds number or Re, which is named after Osborne Reynolds, a Victorian scientist who not only studied fluid dynamics, but is a man that knows how to rock a beard and bowtie.If everything’s moving like it should and the blood flow is laminar, the linear velocity of the blood  -- how fast it’s moving in a straight line -- is greatest in the center of the blood vessel, and lowest near the walls of the vessel, dropping to zero at the wall. Sometimes, though, blood flow is disrupted, like if it has to pass by a crusty old atherosclerotic plaque along the wall, which reduces the diameter of the blood vessel at that point and causes turbulence. There are a number of factors help predict turbulence, they include the density of the blood, usually denoted by the greek letter rho, the viscosity denoted by the greek letter nu. You can kind of think of a fluid’s viscosity as it’s thickness, like for example the viscosity of honey is greater than that of water. Alright, then there’s velocity of blood flow (v), and the diameter of the blood vessel (d)These values can all be used to come up with a single value—the reynold’s number, often denoted Re, and the equation looks like this: NR = pdv/Generally speaking, if the Reynolds number is low - below 2000, then blood flow will be laminar - think “low” and “laminar”, and if the Reynolds number is above 3000 it’ll be turbulent. A Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 is somewhere in between. As a real-life example, a person with anemia has a low red blood cell count, and in general has a lower hematocrit, the ratio of red blood cells to total blood volume. This essentially means the blood’s less thick or viscous, which means based on our equation, if viscosity decreases, reynolds number increases. Also, these individuals often have an increased cardiac output, which means increased blood velocity and therefore increased reynolds number.Another example would be a person with a thrombus, or blood clot, which just like the atherosclerotic plaque would narrow or decrease the diameter of the blood vessel...now, at first glance this seems a little weird eh? But it turns out that blood velocity also depends on the diameter of the vessel, by the equation velocity equals flow rate over area, which after subbing for the area of the blood vessel, is 4Q over pi d^2, so plugging that in for velocity, we see that as diameter decreases, reynolds number increases!Now a related concept is shear. Now, remember how the velocity of the blood depended on whether it was in the center or near the walls? Where it’s fastest in the middle and really slow near the walls, in fact at the molecular level, just outside the walls, water molecules are just sort of loitering around not moving! If we freeze it and plot these velocities, we’ll notice that this difference in velocity is parabolic, meaning that as you move away from the walls, velocity at first jumps up pretty quick, but as you near the middle, the change in velocity is pretty low. This difference in relative velocities is the shear! So if we wanted to plot shear, near the wall where velocity’s changing the most, shear’s actually the highest, and in the middle shear is very low and actually drops to zero.Shear goes hand-in-hand with viscosity, because the higher the shear, the lower the viscosity of the blood. This is because shear helps to pull the elements in the blood apart decreasing it's stickiness, or viscosity, making blood less viscous at the vessel walls and more viscous in the middle of the vessel.Now, let’s say all the blood’s somehow moving at the same velocity. Well in that case, if you plot it out, there’s no change in velocity across the blood vessel, and that makes plotting shear pretty easy...since there’s no change in velocity there’s no shear, and likewise this fluid isn’t viscous!###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: The Reynold’s number is written as Re = density times diameter times velocity over viscosity, and is a way to predict when fluid’s going to be either laminar or turbulent. In general, Reynold’s numbers below 2000 will have laminar flow, and Reynolds numbers above 3000 will have turbulent flow. Furthermore, differences in velocity across a blood vessel causes shear.\"],\n",
              "  5: ['Blood flow refers to the volume of blood travelling through a blood vessel, an organ, or the entire body over a period of time, and it can be measured as liters per minute. As blood flows, it encounters various factors that resist flow and movement of blood, known as the vascular resistance.The first factor to contribute to vascular resistance is blood viscosity, where you can think of viscosity as the fluid’s thickness, or how sticky it is. The relationship is directly proportional, which can be represented as resistance ∝ η which is the greek letter eta and represents viscosity. So this means that as viscosity goes up, it’s harder it is for the liquid’s molecules to slide past each other, and the resistance goes up. Think about a heaping stack o’ pancakes, then picture some maple syrup. Even on flipping the syrup upside down it doesn’t really come out right away and resists moving right away; slowly it gloops out and doesn’t splash but just coats those pancakes in a delicious film of sugary goodness, oh right. Now, with another stack, grab some orange juice and pour...it immediately comes out and pretty goes everywhere. This is because the the juice is less viscous than the syrup, so there’s going to be less resistance to movement. Because blood is full of large proteins and cells, it’s pretty viscous and moves much more slowly than just plain water, or orange juice. Blood viscosity doesn’t change much over time, but certain conditions like polycythemia, where the person has too many red blood cells, can increase viscosity, and conditions like anemia, where the person doesn’t have enough red blood cells, can decrease viscosity.A second factor that affects resistance is total blood vessel length. Just like with viscosity, the relationship is directly proportional, and this can be represented as resistance ∝ L, so, simply put, shorter vessels have less resistance and longer vessels have more resistance because there’s more friction resisting flow. This means that as a child grows into an adult, their blood vessels will get longer, and their peripheral resistance will go up.A third factor that affects resistance is blood vessel radius, which in this case is inversely proportional to resistance...to the fourth power! Meaning that that as a vessel’s radius goes down, its resistance really goes up. Unlike viscosity and length, the radius can change from minute to minute, especially the radius of arterioles, which can vasoconstrict like when you’re lying at home on the couch, which would decrease diameter and increase resistance, or vasodilate like when you’re running outside playing frisbee, which would increase diameter and decrease resistance.Now, the equation relating all these variables is resistance R is equal to 8 times viscosity eta times length L divided by pi times radius r to the fourth power.Now keep in mind that resistance is also related to blood pressure and blood flow by the relationship: Q = . So let’s apply this to a real-life situation, let’s say a person has a blood flow of 300 ml/min going through their carotid artery and they suddenly develop a blockage of exactly half of the artery, which can happen in a stroke, what would happen to the blood flow? Well, a 50% blockage means that the radius is now ½ of what it was, and looking at our equation, since nothing else has changed, plugging in 1/2r for our original r, we get ½ r to the fourth or 1/16 r, meaning resistance goes up by 16 times! iAssuming that the blood pressure doesn’t change right away, subbing in this new 16 times greater resistance, we see that the blood flow drops by 16 times,i from 300 ml/min to 300 ml/min / 16 = 19 ml/min, which is a huge drop!So that’s how resistance works for a single vessel. Now, what if you have a bunch of different sized vessels in a row, each with their own resistance, and you wanted to figure out the total resistance? Well since, they’re in a row one after another, we say they’re in series, and you simply add the individual resistances all together to get a total resistance. That’s called the serial resistance. As an example, let’s think about blood heading out to a cell in your toe and back. After leaving your heart, It has to go through an artery, then through an arteriole, then through a capillary alongside that toe cell, then back through a venule, and finally through a vein to reach the heart. If we add up all of those individual resistances, our total will equal the total resistance faced by the blood flow going to the toe cell and then back to the heart, assuming there are no branches in the system and no other cells to worry about. When we arrange resistance in series like this, the blood flow through each part of the system is the same, but the resistance at each level will differ mostly based on the length and radius of each vessel. So far, so good. Of course, this doesn’t account for the millions of branch points in the circulatory system, and for that we have to think about the concept of parallel resistance. In short, it’s when two vessels branch and move blood in parallel and then meet up again, which is exactly what happens in the circulatory system since there is a lot of branching and ultimately all of the blood meets up again in the right atrium. To calculate the total resistance for these portions where the vessels split, we use1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + etc.So to apply these two equations, let’s say that we want to figure out the total resistance here. In this case we have five different resistances to worry about. Now let’s give these some numbers, Let’s say we’ve got a larger but longer blood vessel with a resistance of 6, and then it branches into three. The very thin blood vessel in the middle has a resistance of 10, and the slightly larger ones on either side both have a resistance of 5. Then all the branches come back together and connect to a short wide vessel with a resistance of 2. Now, these resistances do have units, but for simplicity’s sake I’m not showing them, but in case you’re curious resistance is measured as mmHg・minutes/Liter. To figure out the total resistance we need to break this down into two parts, and we’re going to add up the parallel resistance of the three vessels in the middle first. So that’s ⅕ + 1/10 + ⅕, which is 2/10 + 1/10 + 2/10, which is 5/10, which remember is equal to 1 over R total. So if we flip 1/Rtotal and 5 over 10, we get Rtotal equals 10 over 5 which equals 2. So this is the resistance of this chunk of parallel vessels. That makes sense, because with parallel resistance, the total is always less than the resistance of any one component. Now that we have the combined resistance of the parallel guys, the remaining are just in series, so we just add up 6 + 2 + 2, and that’s 10 or 10 mmHg・minutes/Liter, which just happens to be right around the actual resistance you see in the entire systemic circulation, by comparison, the pulmonary circulation has only 1/10th of that resistance, it’s closer to 1 mmHg・minutes/Liter.It’s also worth mentioning quick that, just like before, the flow through these bits in series is the same, along with the total flow through this whole parallel system. The flow through each of these parallel vessels though, is not the same, since the blood has to split flow through each of the vessels, although, the sum of these three flows must equal the total flow!###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: vascular resistance is a measure of the resistance that must be overcome to push blood through the vessels, and can be represented by the equation 8 times viscosity eta times length L divided by pi times r^4i, so it’s directly proportional to the viscosity and the length, and inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power. Resistance in series is equal to the sum of each resistance, and one over the resistance in parallel is equal to the sum of the inverse of each resistance.'],\n",
              "  6: ['Compliance, which is sometimes called capacitance or distensibility, refers to the ability of a vessel to respond to an increase in pressure by to distending or swell and increase the volume of blood it can hold, or with decreased pressure, a decrease in volume. The way that this applies to blood vessels is to remember that they are stretchable tubes like rubber hoses rather than lead pipes. So if the pressure increases, the walls of the tube can actually stretch out a bit to accommodate a larger volume, and exactly how much they stretch out depends on their compliance.We can calculate a given blood vessel’s compliance, C, by dividing the volume of blood, V, in mL by the amount of pressure (P) in mmHg, that the blood is experiencing. And so we measure compliance in mL / mm Hg.So we can plot out volume as a function of pressure, where the slope, volume over pressure, is the compliance. The veins have high compliance, meaning they’re high-volume, low pressure vessels, and even a small increase in pressure expands the volume a loti. The arteries, on the other hand have low compliance, and are low-volume, high pressure vessels, meaning with same amount of pressure, their volume doesn’t expand as much. Furthermore, a hardened artery would be even less compliant, and is like a lead pipe, in other words it takes an incredible amount of pressure to change the volume even a tiny bit.With that in mind, since veins are more compliant, the majority of the blood in the body at any given time is in the veins, whereas less blood is in the thicker, less compliant arteries at any given time. Now, when the arteries harden due to arteriosclerosis, they become even less compliant over time, which means they can’t hold as much blood volume at the same pressure. That volume of blood is going to wind up in the veins. In this situation, blood simply moves away from the even higher pressure arteries to the area of lowest pressure, typically where the compliance is highest, like the veins. Now, if compliance, or volume over pressure, is it’s tendency to stretch out with pressure, than its inverse would be it’s tendency to not stretch, or another way to think about it is its tendency to recoil back to its original shape, which is a concept known as its elastance E. Both of these concepts are super relevant for large elastic arteries like the aorta, which literally comes right off the heart. Now, first off, heart cells take ATP and use that chemical energy to contract during systole, turning it into mechanical energy. This propels blood out into the aorta. Since it’s moving blood, it has kinetic energy, but also since it’s exerting pressure on the walls of the vessel, it also has pressure energy, a form of potential energy, and the sum of these two is equal to the total energy E, which we’ll represent by this little health bar thing, which is filled with kinetic energy in blue and pressure energy in purple. So, let’s just say that during this time that pressure energy corresponds to a pressure of 140 mmHg. After the heart contracts, it relaxes and is filling with blood, called diastole. Now, during this time the blood’s still moving and there’s still pressure, but it’s just much less energy. So the pressure energy drops significantly, let’s say to something that corresponds to 50 mmHg. The difference between these, in this case 90 mmHg, is called the pulse pressure.Okay, but in reality even though the aorta isn’t very compliant, during systole it still stretches out with these high-pressure contractions, some of that volume is held in this distended space, since it’s very elastic, the walls store some of that energy of contraction as elastic energy in the walls, another form of potential energy. Since the total energy has to stay the same, there’s less pressure and kinetic energy to make way for that elastic energy. so less pressure energy means the blood pressure isn’t as high, let’s say 120 mmHg. Now, during diastole, the elastic walls recoil or snap back, moving that blood that was held during systole out into the circulatory system and that stored elastic energy gets converted back to pressure energy and kinetic energy, so now pressure energy gets added, yielding a pressure of say 60 mmHg, which means the new pulse pressure is lower—60 mmHg.So, with elastic arteries, the blood pressures are 120 over 60, with a difference or pulse pressure of 60 mmHg, and remember without the elastic properties, it was 140 / 50 with a pulse pressure of 90. So here we see these large elastic arteries buffer or dampen the pulse pressure, and this whole phenomenon is known as the Windkessel effect!As a person ages, healthy compliant arteries become stiff and non-compliant, resulting in blood vessels that behave more like the non-elastic case, which means pulse pressure ultimately goes up.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: compliance refers to the volume of blood a vessel can hold at a certain pressure, and this is related to distensibility. Arteries, are low-volume vessels  high-pressure,, and therefore have low compliiance, and veins are high-volume vessels, low-pressure, meaning they have high compliance. Aged arteries become much less compliant, leading to higher blood pressure in the elderly.'],\n",
              "  7: ['The main job of the heart is to pump oxygenated blood with nutrients through the arteries to the body’s tissues and receive back deoxygenated blood full of waste products through the veins. Now, let’s zoom into the left ventricle. There’s a moment when the left ventricle is fully relaxed. It occurs at the end of filling or diastole, also called the end-diastolic point, and the volume of blood within the left ventricle is called the end-diastolic volume, and it’s about 120 milliliters. Then the left ventricle contracts, forcing blood through the aorta and into the whole arterial system. After that is another moment when the left ventricle is fully contracted. It occurs at the end of contraction or systole, also called the end-systolic point, and the volume of blood within the left ventricle is called end-systolic volume, and it’s about 50 milliliters. So, end-diastolic volume minus end-systolic volume, gives us the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood that the left ventricle ejects with every heartbeat, or stroke. In this case, the stroke volume is 120 minus 50, which equals 70 milliliters. Stroke volume is a useful measurement, but it can vary based on the size of a person. For example, a stroke volume of 50 milliliters might be absolutely fine for a small person with a small heart volume, but may be low for a large person with a bigger heart volume. So another helpful measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume, Ejection fraction = Stroke Volume / End- Diastolic Volume. In a normal individual that’s 70/120, or about 58%, but it can fluctuate between 50 and 65% and still be considered normal. In other words, at least half of the blood volume in the left ventricle should get pumped out during each heartbeat. In hearts that have a low contractility - a low force of contraction - the ejection fraction can fall below 50%.  Every minute, though, our heart beats many times, so if we multiply the stroke volume times the heart rate, or the times our heart beats per minute, we’ll get the cardiac output, which is the total volume of blood the left ventricle ejects in one minute. Using the stroke volume of 70 ml/ beat and a resting heart rate of 70 beats/minute, cardiac output is 4900 ml/min, or 4.9 liters/min. Remember that a normal adult body contains approximately 5 liters of blood, so this means that every last drop of blood travels through the left ventricle at least once every minute! Of course, the heart can adjust it’s heart rate and the stroke volume based on whether you’re sleeping or doing exercise. In fact, trained athletes can have a cardiac output that reaches up to 35 liters/ minute! The cardiac output flows through the arteries and is distributed to the various organs meet their oxygen and nutrient demands. Of all of the organs, the liver receives the largest amount of blood flow. The kidneys also get a lot of blood flow, but less than the liver. However, when correcting for the mass of these tissues, the kidney gets much more blood per gram of tissue than any other organ - and this is called tissue perfusion. So flow refers to the total amount of blood volume going someplace like an organ over time, and perfusion refers to the total amount of blood volume going to a gram of tissue over time. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle in a single heartbeat. The ejection fraction is the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat, which serves as a measure of the heart’s contractility. Finally, cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped in one minute.'],\n",
              "  8: [\"More than a century ago, two physiologists, Otto Frank and Ernest Starling discovered that as the heart gets filled up with more blood during diastole, it contracts harder and pumps out more blood during systole. So they came up with the Frank Starling Law to explain this relationship. To understand this relationship, let’s zoom into the wall of the ventricles. The bulk of these walls is made up of short, branched cardiac muscle cells packed one next to the other. Zooming in further, if we look inside the muscle cells, we see bundles of myofibrils, or long chains of sarcomeres. The sarcomere is the smallest structure in the muscle that is capable of contracting so it's considered the basic contractile unit of the muscle. The sarcomere has two Z discs that form its boundary and a M line in the middle.  Attached to the Z disc are thin filaments made of actin protein. These actin filaments have structural polarity which means both ends of the filament look different.  We can think of it like an arrow with the pointed end being the “minus end,” pointing towards the M line, and the tail end being the “plus end,” attached to the Z disc. Just like an arrow, the actin filament can only move in one direction: the direction it’s pointed at.  Attached to the M line are the myosin filaments which are thick bundles of myosin proteins with two globular heads. During a muscle contraction, the myosin heads grabs onto the actin filaments, and pull them towards the M line which brings the two Z discs closer together.  Overall, the amount of tension developed, or the force of muscle contraction during systole, depends on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin. And this number directly depends on the length of the overlapping section between actin and myosin filaments. The length of the overlapping section depends on the overall length of the sarcomere. And the length of the sarcomere depends on how much blood fills the ventricle during diastole - because that affects how stretched out the overall muscle wall and each sarcomere within it end up being. This relationship is known as the cardiac length-tension relationship and it can be shown by this  graph, with the sarcomere length or the ventricular end- diastolic volume on the x axis and the tension or pressure developed within the ventricle, during their contraction, or systole, on the y axis.So let’s imagine that the ventricles are mostly empty, with almost no blood in them.  This would mean that there’s nothing stretching the muscles in the ventricular wall, so the length of sarcomeres are really short. At this length, the two Z discs are pulled close to each and there’s not much room for further contraction. Furthermore, the actin filaments from each side of the sarcomere crosses the M line and overlap. Since actin can be pulled only in one direction- towards the midline, myosin has to attach and pull the actin filament with the right structural polarity: the one pointing in the same direction as that the myosin pulls. So, when the actin filaments overlap, myosin is prevented from binding to its own actin filament by the actin filament from the other side with the wrong polarity. As a result, very few myosin- actin attachments are made and the cells can contract only very weakly during systole. On the graph, we can see near the point of origin, the short length of myocardial fibers corresponds with a low contractile force. As the ventricles fill with more blood returning through the veins, their walls get more and more stretched and that stretches out every single sarcomere in the muscle cells as well. This means that there’s more space, and no actin overlapping which allows more myosin heads to properly interact with actin and as a result, create more force, or tension, during contraction. Looking at the graph, this would make our curve move steadily upwards with increasing force as there’s increasing volume. This stretching can go on until it exceeds a maximal point, after which things start getting too stretched out. This means the Z discs are so far apart from each other that there’s only little overlap between actin and myosin filaments and actin gets out of reach from myosin. As a result, there's a decreased number of myosin heads that manage to attach to actin and pull it towards the M line.  This leads to a decreased force of contraction, so the curve starts falling off again. Now, that we’ve seen the relationship between length of the sarcomeres and tension during contraction in systole, let’s look at the Frank Starling relationship. This can be also be plotted onto a similar graph, with the ventricular end- diastolic volume on the x axis and the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood pumped out by the ventricle with each heartbeat, on the y axis. So, at the start of the curve, near the bottom left- hand corner, we have a low end diastolic volume meaning very little blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. So sarcomeres are squeezed together with very few myosin heads binding to actin. This results in a weak contraction during systole and a low stroke volume. As the volume of blood returning to the ventricles increases, sarcomeres stretch, and there’s more myosin-actin binding, so a greater strength of the contraction is achieved and stroke volume rises. That’s true until the end- diastolic volume becomes so high, and the myosin and actin get too far apart, the number of myosin and actin binding decreases, resulting in a weaker contraction, so the stroke volume falls off again.Keep in mind though that this curve reflects the heart’s intrinsic ability to vary the strength of contraction based on the volume of blood that it’s filled with.  Within the body, though, there are plenty of extrinsic signals as well like nerve or hormonal stimuli and medications. Some of these signals, like stimulation from the sympathetic nervous system or the medication digoxin, can have a positive inotropic effect on the heart. This means that at a given end- diastolic volume, they increase the strength of contraction, moving the curve upwards and increasing the stroke volume. On the other hand, there are negative inotropic agents, like medications like beta- blockers, that decrease the strength of contraction, moving the curve downwards and decreasing stroke volume. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, the Frank- Starling relationship between end-diastolic volume, contraction strength, and stroke volume states that the strength of ventricular contraction and the volume of blood ejected by the ventricle depends on the blood volume present in the ventricle at the end of diastole. \"],\n",
              "  9: ['Pressure- volume loops are graphs, where the pressure inside the left ventricle is on the y axis and the volume of the left ventricle is on the x axis. Each loop represents one cardiac cycle, including both ventricular systole and diastole, or more simply, one heartbeat. Alright, let’s start at the lower right hand corner. This is the end-diastolic point, and it’s the point in the cardiac cycle when diastole is over. The mitral valve, or the “communicating door” between the left atrium and left ventricle has just closed. And as it closed, it made a loud, long sound, kind of like a “lup”. That’s known as the first heart sound, or S1. So, at this point, the left ventricle is filled with the maximum volume of blood, known as end- diastolic volume, which is normally about 120 milliliters. You can imagine the ventricle as a relaxed sack of muscle that’s full of blood, so pressure is low. After that, the left ventricle contracts, and that marks the beginning of systole. This makes the pressure shoot up, but since both mitral and aortic valves are closed, blood can neither enter nor leave the ventricle, the volume doesn’t change. This phase is called isovolumetric contraction and it lasts for about 0.05 seconds. Eventually the pressure inside the left ventricle reaches approximately 75 mmHg, becoming just higher than the pressure inside the aorta, forcing the aortic valve to pop open. This pressure reflects the pressure in the aorta right at the beginning of ejection phase, or the lowest that the blood pressure in the aorta is going to be and is known as the diastolic blood pressure, or DBP for short. Okay, now, once the ejection phase starts, it lasts for about 0.25 seconds. That’s when blood is ejected out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, decreasing left ventricular volume. The left ventricle continues to contract, so ventricular pressure keeps rises further. Meanwhile, blood is rushing through the aorta, so its pressure increases, as well. In fact, during this phase, left ventricular and aortic  pressures are essentially equal. This goes on, until they reach a peak of about 120 mmHg, known as systolic blood pressure, or SBP for short, before finally starting to come down again. The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures, in this case 120 - 75 equals 45 mmHg and is called pulse pressure, because it reflects the throbbing pulsation felt in an artery during systole. Eventually, aortic pressure exceeds the pressure within the left ventricle, so the aortic valve snaps shut, making a short, sharp sound, kind of like a “dub”. And this dub is called the second heart sound, or S2. So, this marks the end of the systolic period, also known as end-systolic point. At this point, the volume left inside the left ventricle, known as end- systolic volume, is normally about 50 milliliters. If we calculate the difference between end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, we’ll get the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood the left ventricle ejects or simply, squeezes away, on every heartbeat, or stroke, during this ejection period. In this case, 120 minus 50 is a stroke volume of 70 milliliters. Stroke volume is a useful measurement, but it can vary based on the size of a person’s heart. So another helpful measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume, Ejection fraction = Stroke Volume / End- Diastolic Volume. In this example, it’s 70/120, or about 58%. In other words, 58% of the blood volume in the left ventricle gets pumped out during each heartbeat.  Once the aortic valve has closed, the ventricular muscle starts relaxing, so pressure within the ventricle falls. However, all valves are closed, so the volume remains constant. This is the isovolumetric relaxation phase, and it lasts for about 0.15 seconds. Eventually, the pressure drops below left atrial pressure, and that allows the mitral valve to open. Due to the pressure gradient, blood from the left atrium flows into the ventricle, at the beginning passively, and at the very end, with an extra push, due to the atrial contraction. As the left ventricle fills with blood, its volume comes back up to 120 ml, or its end- diastolic value, while its pressure increases only slightly. Actually, this relaxation phase goes on for kind of a long time period, compared to the previous phases, about 0.55 sec, until there’s no more pressure gradient between the two heart chambers and mitral valve closes, letting the cycle start all over again.All this happens during one heartbeat. With every heartbeat, or stroke, the heart is doing work. And that’s called “stroke work” and it’s proportional to the area inside the loop. In other words, the bigger the loop and the more the area inside of it, the more stroke work our heart does. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, pressure- volume loops are graphs showing the changing relationship between left ventricular pressure and volume during a cardiac cycle and can provide us with useful information, such as stroke volume or end- diastolic volume, as well as systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure.'],\n",

Blood leaves the left ventricle and goes into the aorta, decreasing left ventricular volume. The left ventricle continues to contract, so ventricular pressure keeps rises further, but then falls slightly and finally the aortic valve shuts when aortic pressure exceeds the left ventricular pressure. That point, called the end-systolic point, marks the end of systole. At this point, left ventricular pressure is called end-systolic pressure, and left ventricular volume is called end-systolic volume. The difference between end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, is the stroke volume. After that, the left ventricular muscle starts relaxing, so left ventricular pressure falls. However, all valves are closed, so the volume remains constant. This phase is isovolumetric relaxation.

This relaxation phase continues until the mitral valve closes, letting the loop start all over again. All this happens during one heartbeat. With every heartbeat, or stroke, the heart is doing work. And that’s called “stroke work” and it’s proportional to the area inside the loop. In other words, the bigger the loop and the more the area inside of it, the more stroke work our heart does.Sometimes, you’ll see this simplified to look more like a box. The vertical dimension of the box is the distance from the x-axis to end-systolic pressure, and the horizontal dimension is the stroke volume. And we can draw it over the pressure volume loop - so that it looks like this. In terms of stroke work, it would be the area inside the box. The box isn’t exactly the same as the loop, but it’s a good approximation. Okay, now that we’ve seen what the normal pressure-volume loop looks like, let’s see how it varies if we change some parameters. First, let’s say we increase the preload by adding more blood to the left ventricle during diastole. That means that during diastole, this bottom line goes further, and that increases the end-diastolic volume. Because of the Frank-Starling relationship, there’s a strong contraction. The isovolumic contraction phase doesn’t look any different, but once blood gets ejected, it’s clear that there’s going to be a larger than normal stroke volume. The end-systolic pressure and volume end up being about the same as what they were before. So an increased preload leads to a larger pressure-volume loop, and that means there’s increased stroke work. Now, let’s say we increase afterload by increasing the blood pressure in the entire arterial system, including in the aorta itself. That means that during isovolumic contraction, the ventricular pressure has to rise higher-than-usual before it exceeds aortic pressure and makes the aortic valve open. During the ejection phase, relatively high-pressured blood leaves until aortic pressure exceeds left ventricular pressure. Since there’s elevated blood pressure, the end-systolic pressure ends up being high as well, and that means that there’s a relatively small stroke volume, and that more blood is left within the left ventricle. In this situation, there’s a trade-off, a smaller stroke volume, with a higher pressure - which means that the stroke work remains relatively stable. Finally, let’s say that we increase contractility, by giving a medication to the heart that makes it contract more forcefully. That means that during the ejection phase, blood is under higher pressure, and therefore, the ejection phase goes on for much longer, eventually ending when the left ventricular pressure equates the aortic pressure at the same end-systolic pressure, but now that point occurs with a much smaller left ventricular volume. In this situation, there’s a big increase in stroke work, because there’s a larger stroke volume and even though the end-systolic pressure is unchanged, the blood is under higher pressure, so it increases the size of the pressure-volume loop. #SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, pressure- volume loops can be used to visualize the effects of changing preload, afterload, and contractility. An increase in preload and contractility, increases the size of the pressure-volume loop and therefore increases the stroke work. An increase in afterload, increases the pressure, but decreases the stroke volume, and that means that the stroke work remains relatively stable.'],\n",
              "  11: ['Action potentials are the really rapid electrical changes that occur across the membrane of certain cells, and often propagates from one cell to an adjacent cell. Cells in the heart communicate this way. That signal’s gotta start somewhere, so some of these cells, called pacemaker cells, have the responsibility of  setting the rhythm and the pace of the heartbeat. They’ve got this really important job, but they’re a relatively tiny group -- only about 1% of the heart cells -- and they’re able to continually generate new action potentials that get conducted to the rest of the heart -- the other 99% -- and that’s what tells the heart pump. Now, pacemaker cells also listen to which usually come from neighboring pacemaker cells. But if those don’t come, then a pacemaker cell will simply launch its own and that action potential will then spread around. This is called automaticity, and that’s easy to remember because it’s got “automatic” right in it. So let’s start by mapping out those pacemaker cells. The first clump of pacemaker cells is tucked up here into the corner of the right atria, and that’s the sinoatrial node, which sometimes gets called the SA node. We’ve also got pacemaker cells in internodal tracts between nodes, in the atrioventricular, or AV node, the Bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers, and that’s our electrical conduction system.And all around these pacemaker cells are heart muscle cells or cardiomyocytes and they pick up the action potential too, but that happens just a tiny bit more slowly -- we can think of these bands of pacemaker cells as highways that carry the action potential to its destination super fast, and then the muscle cells are like little side roads where it’s slower. That’s important because we want all of the myocytes to pick up that action potential and contract at the same time. We call this whole system a functional syncytium, which means that the mechanical, chemical, and electrical connections between these cells allow them to act as one unit in some ways, and it’s the pacemaker cells that make that happen.Okay, now let’s take a closer look at the chemistry that gets that action potential moving. Action potentials are initiated by depolarization, which is the opposite of polarization. Polarization is when there’s a higher negative charge inside the cell relative to outside the cell, and that difference in charge is called the membrane potential. So if the membrane potential is negative the inside of the cell is more negative than the outside, if it’s positive the inside is more positive than the outside, and if it’s 0mV, then the inside and outside have the same charge - there’s 0mV of difference. Ok -- so, the key here is understanding how the membrane potential changes, and it all comes down to the movement of ions. Specifically, two factors -- which ion wants to move across the membrane, and how permeable the membrane is to that ion. So, depolarization is when ions move across the membrane and the membrane potential becomes less negative or even slightly positive. Think of a really pessimistic negative cell throwing his hands up and enjoying a moment of joy. When one cell depolarizes enough - it can cause some ions to flow into neighboring cells and trigger them to depolarize as well. If one cell after another depolarizes, then there’s a depolarization wave which you can imagine would look like a wave moving through a crowd at a football stadium. Each depolarization wave causes heart muscle contraction, so the rate at which depolarization waves ripple through the heart actually sets the heart rate. So if depolarization waves are going through about once per second, that means that your heart beats once per second, or sixty times in a minute. Now let’s focus on a single pacemaker cell going through a single action potential. The action potential of both pacemaker cells and myocytes are broken into five phases, often shown on a graph of membrane potential vs. time. We’re going to start at Phase 4, because why not.Phase 4 is the pacemaker potential phase, and it starts when the pacemaker cell is just sort of hanging out with an overall charge or membrane potential of -65mV. Pacemaker cells have ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, or HCN channels on their surface. That’s a lot to take in, but basically these little HCN channels are like gates that open when the membrane potential gets really negative, like -65mV, and they specifically let in just positively charged sodium ions. An electric current is a flow of electric charge, so when these sodium ions rush into the cell, it’s a type of current that scientists have named the funny current, which is a super weird name. There’s nothing funny about it, it should be called the salty current. So as the sodium flows in through the HCN channels, in other words, as the cell becomes more permeable to sodium, the membrane potential starts to depolarize slowly, or drift upwards all the way to about -50mV. After phase 4 is phase 0, this phase is also known as the depolarization phase, even though the cell was slowly depolarizing in phase 4. Once the cell’s membrane potential reaches about -50mV, voltage-gated calcium channels start to open up, allowing calcium to flow into the cell. With sodium and calcium flowing into the cell, the membrane potential rises all the way up past 0mV and into positive territory - peaking out at about +10mV. This happens super-fast, lasting only about 0.5 milliseconds. The calcium channels remain open until it hits about the +10mV mark, at which point they start to close.Once the cell hits +10mV, we’re in Phase 3. That’s because pacemaker cells don’t have a Phase 1 or Phase 2  -- they just go right from depolarizing to repolarizing again. At this point the potassium channels open up and the calcium channels close up, so the only ion channels that remains open are the potassium channels which allow potassium to leave the cell, and the HCN channels which allow sodium to enter the cell. Because there are so many potassium ion channels relative to HCN channels, there’s a net outward positive current, meaning that positively charged ions are leaving the cell faster than they’re coming in. So, the membrane potential goes down again, all the way back to about -65 mV, which means that one full heartbeat has taken place, and then the whole process starts over with phase 4 again.###SUMMARYOkay, to recap: pacemaker cells generate action potentials automatically, and this sets the heart rate. Each action potential spreads through the heart muscle cells in a process called a depolarization wave; each depolarization wave leading to a heart beat. There are three phases of a pacemaker action potential, phase 4 which is the slow depolarization, phase 0 which is the rapid depolarization, and phase 3 which is the repolarization.  '],\n",
              "  12: ['Cardiac excitability refers to the amount of inward current needed by myocytes or myocardial cells, cells in the muscular middle layer of the heart, to depolarize or generate an action potential. Whether or not it depolarizes depends on if its voltage-gated «sodium ion channels are excitable or not. A more excitable cell might have more of its Na+ ion channels in the ready state, and even if there were a relatively weak current of Na+ ions flowing in, the cell might still depolarize easily. On the other hand, a less excitable cell might have most of it’s Na+ ion channels inactivated, where they won’t open in response to stimuli, represented by this little ball stuck in the opening, and only a few of them are ready, and it would require a strong current of Na+ ions to flow in before it depolarized. So let’s say this is a myocyte in one of the ventricles,, And this is a graph of membrane potential over time. First, a few positive ions like sodium and calcium travel through gap junctions and enter into the cell, raising the membrane potential to a threshold level—typically around 70 mV. At that point, the voltage gated Na+ channels open up, and lots of Na+ ions rush into the cell, causing depolarization. Right after depolarizing, at about +20 mV, the channels become inactivated, making those channels unavailable for another depolarization. After the upstroke, there’s the plateau, and then as the cell repolarizes the sodium channels start to recover, and even though they’re closed, they’re still excitable, and eventually the cell repolarizes back to it’s usual state around -90mV..During most of the action potential, the myocardial cell is unable to depolarize again, and this is called the absolute refractory period. In other words, during the absolute refractory period, pretty much all the myocyte’s sodium channels are inactivated, so , so even if a bunch of inward current comes from the neighboring cell, it literally can’t depolarize.There are many Na+ channels on each myocardial cell, and each Na+ channel operates independently, but overall, most of them remain inactivated after the upstroke, through, the plateau, and until the cell has repolarized to about −50 mV, at which point some channels start to recover, at which point the cell would respond to a stimulus.. Now the way that the absolute refractory period is measured is that an electrophysiologist delivers a current to a myocardial cell and in response it has an action potential. While that action potential is happening, the electrophysiologist delivers multiple bursts of current to the cell at regular intervals. If a burst of current causes nothing to happen, then that means the cell is still in the absolute refractory period. But if a burst of current causes the cell to depolarize, then that means that the cell has emerged from the absolute refractory period. Since the bursts of current are given at intervals, we landed just outside the absolute refractory period, it’s possible that the burst of current was given at the exact moment that the cell was emerging from it’s absolute refractory period. But it’s more likely that the cell emerged from the absolute refractory period at some point and then waited a tiny bit before the next burst of current was applied. In some cases the burst of current that’s used isn’t very strong, and as a result the cell may not depolarize even though it’s no longer in the absolute refractory period. So when electrophysiologists are measuring the absolute refractory period, what they end up identifying is called the effective refractory period. Next comes the relative refractory period, which begins at the end of the absolute refractory period and keeps going until the cell membrane has almost completely repolarized. During this period, some of the Na+ channels have recovered and are available for another depolarization, and the proportion of Na+ channels increases over time. A cell in the relative refractory period can depolarize, but it needs a bigger stimulus than normal. Finally, we’ve got the supranormal period, where supra- means “more than,” and this is when the myocardial cell is more excitable than usual. The supranormal period starts when the membrane potential is −70 mV, and it keeps going until the membrane is fully repolarized back to −85 mV. At this point, the Na+ channels have completely recovered, and the inactivation gates are open again. But, the cell’s membrane potential is closer to the threshold than it is at rest, so it’s slightly easier for the cell to depolarize.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap. When the cell’s at -90 mV it’s resting, and all the sodium channels are closed, but ready to rock. Once a stimulus comes in, the channels open for a short period during the upstroke. The absolute refractory period is when the myocardial cell’s Na+ channels are inactivated and it absolutely cannot depolarize in response to a burst of current. The effective refractory period is often used interchangeably with the absolute refractory period, and represents the practical limitations of trying to measure the absolute refractory period and is therefore a tiny bit longer. The relative refractory period is when some of the myocardial cell’s Na+ channels are open, and so the cell is able to depolarize in response to a larger than normal burst of current. The supranormal period is when all of the myocardial cell’s Na+ channels are recovered and ready to depolarize, but the cell is not fully repolarized and therefore is closer to threshold than when it’s fully repolarized..

              "  13: ['Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is the relationship between electrical signals in the form of action potentials, and mechanical changes in the heart muscle cells, called cardiomyocytes, that causes them to contract. Let’s start by looking at the structure of a cardiomyocyte. Cardiomyocytes have branches, and have intercalated disks along their edges which have small holes called gap junctions that allow ions to flow from one cardiomyocyte to the next. When a cardiomyocyte depolarizes, ions like calcium move from that cell into a neighboring cell, and these ions trigger depolarization to happen in that cell. This is what makes cardiomyocytes part of a “functional syncytium,” they’re like a little community of cells intimately working together. In addition, cardiomyocytes stay physically attached to one another through proteins called desmosomes, which are like staples that hold the cells together when they’re contracting. Another feature of cardiomyocytes are passageways called transverse tubules, or T-tubules. T-tubules are extensions of the outside environment. They increase the surface area of the cardiomyocyte and they look like the letter T, so it’s easy to remember their name. Think of a large walk-through aquarium: you can walk through tunnels and look at the sea creatures all around you, but you’re not in the water with them. Finally, there’s the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is an organelle that stores intracellular calcium, the calcium that is sequestered inside the cell. When a depolarization wavefront hits a cardiomyocyte, a few calcium ions flow through gap junctions, and if a threshold membrane potential is reached, then sodium channels start to open up. If there’s a depolarization, then ions start to move across the cell membrane, and that’s where the T-tubules play a key role. During the part of the cardiomyocyte action potential when calcium ions flow into the cell, the presence of T-tubules helps bring calcium deep into the cell. Once this extracellular calcium gets inside, it binds to the ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which releases even more calcium into the cell - a process called calcium-induced calcium release. The calcium helps activate two contractile proteins, actin and myosin, which are called myofilaments, and are ultimately responsible for cell contraction, and that’s the key moment when the chemical signal is converted into a mechanical signal. When calcium ions enter the cardiomyocyte, they bind to troponin C, which is attached to a long thin protein called tropomyosin. Tropomyosin is draped around yet another protein filament called actin, and it covers up binding sites on the actin, so that it cannot be bound by myosin heads which are lurking nearby. A bit like a protective parent not wanting a child to go out on a date. The calcium ions bind to Troponin C and that causes tropomyosin to slide off of the actin filament, exposing the actin binding sites. At that point, myosin heads bind to actin forming a cross-bridge - when the parent’s away, the children will play. The myosin head pushes past the actin with a “power stroke”, effectively pulling the actin and myosin filaments past one another and shortening the muscle. The myosin does this a few times with actin - binding, sliding past, reattaching, and then repeating this process and using up ATP along the way. The myosin head looks a bit like an oar in a boat, it hits the water, shifts, and comes out, and this only works in the presence of calcium ions. Eventually, calcium ions are removed by ion transporters, that rely on ATP or concentration gradients. Most of the calcium gets moved back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum or the extracellular environment, and some also moves into the mitochondria. Once that calcium is gone, the troponin goes back to its original shape, which blocks the binding sites on the actin and prevents more cross-bridges from forming. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: cardiac excitation-contraction coupling is when an action potential is converted into mechanical energy. Calcium ions move into the cell via T-tubules and bind to troponin. The troponin changes conformation and exposes more of the actin filament, which has binding sites for myosin. Myosin-actin bridges form using ATP and are part of the power stroke that pulls actin and myosin closer together - forming the basis for muscle contraction.'],\n",
              "  14: [\"An electrocardiogram is also known as an ECG; the Dutch and German version of the word, elektrokardiogram, is shortened to EKG. It is a tool used to visualize, or “gram,” the electricity, or “electro,” that flows through the heart, or “cardio.” Specifically, a 12-lead ECG tracing shows how the depolarization wave, which is a wave of positive charge, moves during each heartbeat, by providing the perspectives of different sets of electrodes. This particular set of electrodes is called lead II; one electrode is placed on the right arm and the other on the left leg. Essentially, when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection. This big, positive deflection corresponds to the wave moving down the septum. To understand the basics, let’s start with an example of how we can look at the heart with only one pair of electrodes: a positive and a negative one. These electrodes detect the charge on the outside of the cell. Remember, at rest, cells are negatively charged relative to the slightly positive outside environment; let’s make these cells red. When they depolarize, the cells become positively charged, and leave a slightly negative charge in the outside environment; let’s make these cells green. Now, if we freeze this “wave of depolarization” as it’s moving through the cells, half of the cells are negative, or depolarized, and half are positive and resting; therefore, there’s a difference of charge across this set of cells. You can think of the charge difference as being a dipole, because there are two electrical poles. We can draw this dipole out as an arrow, or vector, pointing towards the positive charge. Remember, the electrodes detect charge on the outside of the cell, so this points toward where the positive charge is, outside. Now, if there’s a dipole vector pointing toward the positive electrode, then the ECG tracing shows it as a positive deflection; the bigger the dipole is, the bigger the deflection is. If we unpause this, then everything becomes depolarized. Since there’s no difference in charge, there’s no dipole, and thus no deflection. Moments later, a wave of repolarization goes through, and the cells become negative once again. Pausing halfway through again, now the vector dipole goes in the opposite direction, and faces the negative electrode; this means that there will be a negative ECG tracing. Again, the bigger the dipole is, the bigger the negative deflection is. Even though it’d be nice if the depolarization wave lined up perfectly with the electrodes, usually that’s not the case. So, we simply look at the vector component that is parallel to that electrode. For example, let’s say that the depolarization happened this way, at an angle; then, we’d simply break the vector into two parts. The one we care about is the one that’s going towards the positive electrode, which causes a deflection, even though it’s a slightly smaller deflection than previously. In other words, the size of the deflection on the ECG tracing always corresponds to the magnitude, or size, of the dipole in the direction of the electrode. The perpendicular component isn’t pointing at the electrodes, so it doesn’t cause any deflection. In fact, if there’s a depolarization wave that goes straight up, perpendicular to the positive and negative electrodes, there would be no deflection! In a standard ECG, there are 10 electrodes: four limb electrodes, with one each on the left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg; and six precordial electrodes, V1 through V6, that wrap around the chest. The right leg electrode is usually used as a neutral lead. The heart is a three-dimensional organ, so V1 through V6 line up in the transverse, or horizontal, plane of the heart. Each electrode is set up to detect any wave of positive charge coming towards it. These are collectively called the chest leads. Meanwhile, in the coronal plane, the non-neutral leads are called augmented vector right, or aVR, on the right arm, and augmented vector left, or aVL, on the left arm. Both of these leads are represented as vectors that are 30 degrees up from the horizontal line. Augmented vector foot, or aVF, is on the left foot, which anatomically isn’t straight down, but it’s close enough that it ends up representing the vector facing straight down on the diagram. Just like the precordial electrodes, aVR, aVL, and aVF detect any positive deflection coming towards them. Now, in addition to these three limb leads, there are also bipolar limb leads called lead 1, 2, and 3, which are recorded using two electrodes instead of just one. Lead 1 uses the RA as the negative pole and LA as the positive pole, forming a vector that goes to the right. Lead 2 uses aVR as the negative pole and aVF as the positive pole, forming a vector that goes to the +60 degree mark. Finally, lead 3 uses aVL as the negative pole and aVF as the positive pole, forming a vector that goes to the +120 degree mark. So, in total you’ve got six leads from the limb leads and six from the chest leads, which add up to 12 leads total; in other words, you have a 12-lead ecg.Having different views of the heart is important, because they make it possible for you to see how the wave of depolarization moves through the heart according to each viewpoint. For example, consider how the six chest leads, V1 through V6, register the depolarization wave form called the QRS complex. The very same depolarization wave might appear mostly negative in V1 and V2, isoelectric in V3, and mostly positive in V4, V5, and V6, because the exact direction and magnitude of the vectors are at different points in time. Similarly, each of the frontal plane leads produces its own perspective of the depolarization wave.The limb leads and chest leads can be grouped based on the regions of the heart that they are nearest. Problems in specific leads, or groups of leads, suggests that there may be a specific region of the heart affected by a disease. Leads II, III, and aVF are “inferior” leads because they’re near the inferior wall of the heart, which receives blood from the right coronary artery. Leads I and aVL, along with two of the chest leads, V5 and V6, are considered “lateral” leads because they’re near the lateral wall of the heart, which receives blood from the left circumflex artery. Finally, V1 and V2 are considered “septal” leads because they’re nearest to the interventricular septum, and V3 and V4 are “anterior” leads because they’re nearest the anterior wall of the heart. Both of the septal and anterior regions are served by the left anterior descending artery. ###SUMMARYAll right, let’s quickly recap. In a standard ECG, there are 10 electrodes: four are limb electrodes, and six are precordial electrodes that wrap around the chest. These electrodes are used to make 12 leads, each of which illustrates the movement of positive charge on the outside of heart cells. The ECG tracing shows a depolarization wave moving towards an electrode as a positive deflection, and one moving away as a negative deflection; each is proportional to the size of the dipole. The benefit of being able to see different views of the heart is that it makes it easier to see how the wave of depolarization moves, which provides valuable information about the heart's structure and function.\"],\n",
              "  15: [\"An electrocardiogram - an ECG - or the dutch and german version of the word - elektrokardiogram or EKG, is a tool used to visualize “gram” the electricity “electro” that flows through the heart “cardio”. An ECG tracing specifically shows how the depolarization wave moves during each heartbeat - which is a wave of positive charge - looks from the perspective of different sets of electrodes. This particular set of electrodes is called lead II, with one electrode on the right arm and the other on the left leg, so essentially when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection, like this big positive deflection correspond to the wave moving down the septum. To read an ECG it’s really helpful to first understand what a normal sinus rhythm looks like.To do that, let’s look at a single heartbeat on an ECG - from the viewpoint of lead II. In a healthy heart, everything starts at the sinoatrial node, or SA node, - which is a little patch of tissue in the wall of the right atrium full of pacemaker cells. When one of these pacemaker cells depolarizes, a wave of positive charge spreads outward and overall it moves from the SA node towards the apex of the heart, so it aligns pretty nicely with the lead II vector.  Now, the heart muscle cells, are often described as having a functional syncytium because even though each one cell has its own cell membrane - the cells also have tiny connections or openings between them. That means that during a depolarization wave, ions can flow right from one cell to the next. Now - it’s also important to mention that the depolarization wave moves at two different speeds through the heart. In the pacemaker cells, which are special types of cardiomycocytes laid out like highways through the heart, it moves really fast, but it moves more slowly through the rest of myocytes which do the contracting - the depolarization wave moves through those like a car moving through congested small streets. The ECG measures out changes in time on the X-axis, where one small box is 0.04 s, and voltage on the Y-axis, with each small box being 0.1 mV, sometimes called 1mm voltage on the Y-axis, with each small box being 0.1mV sometimes called 1mm, with zero being called the “isoelectric line”. Every time there’s a positive or negative deflection away from this line - the isoelectric line. So a depolarization wave starts in the SA node, then goes through atrial intranodal tracts, also called Bachmann's bundle, over to the left atrium so that both atria basically depolarize together. The overall direction of that depolarization wave is in the same direction as the lead II vector, so there is a positive deflection called the P wave.  Meanwhile, the signal also gets carried from the SA node to the AV node where it gets delayed for a bit, and this allows the atria to fully contract filling the ventricles with blood. During this delay, there is no depolarization wave moving towards or away from lead II, so this shows up as a flat line and the interval from the beginning of the P wave through this flat portion is called the PR interval. From there the signal goes through the pacemaker cells that make up the Bundle of His and into the left bundle branch and right bundle branches. In addition to moving through the fast pacemaker cells, the signal also goes through the slow myocytes in the interventricular septum, in a direction that’s slightly away from the lead II vector since there is a lot of this tissue and, and creating a tiny negative deflection on the ECG - a Q wave. From there the depolarization wave flows down into the purkinje fibers. Since the largest vectors are the ones in the left ventricle, this is in the direction of lead II - this creates a large positive deflection on the ECG - an R wave. The apex of the heart depolarizes first, but then the wave moves back up to depolarize the top of the ventricles which is in a direction away from lead II, causing a slight negative deflection on the ECG - an S wave. Together ventricular depolarization creates what is called the QRS complex.After tissue depolarizes, there is a brief period of time when there is no change in electrical activity - so the ECG goes back to the isoelectric line. The exact point at which it hits that line is called the J point, and for a brief time there is no net change in electrical activity, this is the ST segment. After that the ventricles have to repolarize or become negative once more - to reset itself in preparation for another wave of depolarization. Now, repolarization, moves in an overall direction upward, opposite the direction of lead 2, so you might think that that should be a negative deflection, but really it’s a positive deflection, since this time it’s a wave of negative charge, so essentially now when it’s moving opposite to lead II, it’s a positive deflection on ECG. And this final wave is called the T wave. The T wave is more spread out over time then the QRS complex because repolarization is a slower process that takes place at slightly different times for each cardiomyocyte instead of happening all at once like depolarization. It’s also worth mentioning that atrial repolarization doesn’t usually show up at all on the ECG because the small vectors created by it get lost in much larger vectors that get created by the the QRS complex. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap - On an ECG there’s a P wave which corresponds to atrial depolarization wave then an isoelectric line where the depolarization wave goes through the AV node. After that there’s a QRS complex which represents ventricular depolarization, followed by another brief isoelectric pause - the ST segment. Finally there’s a T wave which represents ventricular repolarization. \"],\n",

To read an ECG, there are a few key elements to keep in mind; one is to figure out the QRS transition.The chest leads will have a mostly positive deflection, if a depolarization wave is moving towards them. The QRS transition zone refers to where the QRS complex switches from being mostly negative to mostly positive, from the point of view of the chest leads, V1 through V6, which “view” the heart through the horizontal plane. The QRS transition usually happens in lead V3 or V4, depending on factors such as chest lead placement and the exact anatomy of a person’s heart. So, the QRS transition tells us when the overall QRS vector is aligned in the direction of the chest leads; it’s a way of understanding what’s happening to the QRS axis in the horizontal plane. If something alters the heart’s overall QRS vector, then the QRS transition zone can shift to the right, towards V1 and V2, or to the left, towards V5 and V6. For example, a myocardial infarction leads to the formation of scar tissue that can’t depolarize. Generally speaking, the QRS transition zone will shift away from a region of scar tissue, because it no longer contributes to the overall QRS vector. Consider the following: a blockage in the left circumflex artery can cause infarction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, which would lead to a rightward rotation of the QRS transition zone, toward V1 and V2. Another example would be cardiac hypertrophy, because a thicker muscular wall contributes more to the overall QRS vector. If it’s right ventricular hypertrophy, it would lead to a rightward rotation of the QRS transition zone, towards V1 and V2, similar to the result of an infarction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle. In contrast, a right ventricular infarction or a left ventricular hypertrophy would lead to a leftward rotation of the QRS transition zone, towards V5 and V6. ###SUMMARYAll right, let’s quickly recap. The QRS transition zone, in the horizontal plane, is where the QRS complex switches from being mostly negative to mostly positive; it normally happens in lead V3 or V4. The QRS transition zone rotates away from previous myocardial infarctions, and toward hypertrophied tissue. '],\n",

Essentially, when the wave’s moving toward the left leg electrode, you get a positive deflection. This big, positive deflection corresponds to the wave moving down the septum. To read an ECG, there are a few key elements to keep in mind; one is to figure out the axis. The axis of an ECG is the average direction of electrical movement through the heart during a depolarization. Specifically, axis usually refers to the mean QRS vector, which is the size and direction of the depolarization wave as it moves through the ventricles. Normally, the QRS axis aims downward and to the left in relation to the body. So, if we simplify this heart a bit, normally, the sinoatrial, or SA, node sends an electrical signal that propagates outward through the walls of the heart and contracts both upper chambers. Then, that signal moves to the atrioventricular, or AV, node, where the signal is delayed for a split second, and then goes down into the ventricles, or lower chambers. Here, it moves down the bundle of His into the left and right bundle branches, and into each ventricle’s Purkinje fibers, which causes them to contract as well. On an ECG, the atrial depolarization is seen as a P wave, the ventricular contraction is seen as a QRS complex, and the ventricular repolarization, a period of relaxation, is seen as a T wave. Keep in mind that a depolarization is caused by the movement of positive charge, so if this movement of positive charge is going toward the positive electrode, then it’s captured as a positive deflection on an ECG.With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at the mean, or average, QRS vector. After the depolarization wave arrives at the AV node, it travels down the interventricular septum and begins depolarizing the ventricles. The purkinje fibers sit just below the endocardium, which is the innermost layer of the heart. After the endocardium, there’s the myocardium, the cardiac muscle cells, and finally, the epicardium, which is the outer layer. Therefore, each purkinje fiber initiates a depolarization vector that travels directly outward; it starts in the endocardium, goes through the myocardium, and ends in the epicardium. Because they transmit a depolarization wave so quickly, they all fire off pretty much in unison. The more muscle tissue in the myocardial layer that a vector has to travel through, the large the size of the vector. So, as with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle gets thicker, you get bigger vectors. However, if the heart tissue has been damaged, such as from a heart attack, then you have smaller vectors, because the heart cells can’t depolarize anymore. The position of the diaphragm can also affect vectors, because it’s usually sort of sitting right up against the heart. In obese people, the diaphragm gets pushed upwards, rotating the heart further to the left. In thin people, the diaphragm lowers, rotating the heart a bit the other way. When everything is taken into consideration and all of the individual vectors are added up, there’s one overall representative vector arrow, which starts from the AV node, and points in one direction through the ventricles. Now, vectors can be broken down into two perpendicular vector components, so if you look at the component pointing at the positive lead electrode, that’s what is recorded on the ECG. Therefore, when you plot these vectors over the course of ventricular depolarization, the QRS complex emerges.  All right, to figure out the direction of the axis we can start by looking at lead I and aVF. Lead I moves from right to left across the heart, so anything pointing to the left will be positive in lead I; in contrast, aVF points downward, so any vector pointing downward will be positive in aVF. So, looking at our overall vector from before, it’s pointing both down and to the left, and both are positive. Thus, it’s in the bottom left quadrant between 0 and +90 degrees; that’s a normal axis. If it’s up in lead I and aVF, you can imagine it’s like seeing two thumbs up, which means that everything is okay! If the vector is positive in lead I and negative in aVF, then it’s in this quadrant; it could be normal if it’s between 0 and -30 degrees. However, if it’s between -30 and -90, it could be considered left axis deviation. Left axis deviation can happen when the left ventricle hypertrophies, or when the right ventricle becomes damaged and loses healthy tissue. If the opposite happens, and the vector is negative in lead I and positive in aVF, then it’s in this quadrant between +90 and +180 degrees; we call this right axis deviation. Right axis deviation can happen when the right ventricle hypertrophies, or when the left ventricle is damaged and loses healthy tissue. Finally, if the vector is negative in both lead I and aVF, then it’s a very rare case called extreme right axis deviation between -90 and +180 degrees. This can sometimes happen when there’s an ectopic focus that causes depolarization to start from the bottom of the ventricles, and travel in the reverse direction. It’s also a good idea to double check that the leads are placed correctly.  Now, you can figure out the QRS vector, within 30 degrees, by looking at someone’s ECGs. Specifically, to do so, you’ll look at the six leads, I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF, which correspond to 0 degrees, +60 degrees, +120 degrees, -150, -30, and +90, respectively. Here, lead I is clearly positive, which means that the axis is somewhere over here, and lead aVF is positive; this puts the axis in the lower left quadrant between 0 and +90 degrees, which is a normal axis. To be more precise, it looks like lead III is the closest to being isoelectric, which means equal positive and negative deflections; therefore, lead III must actually run perpendicular to the QRS vector, so 120 degrees subtract 90 degrees is the +30 degree line. Notice that this happens to sit on the same line as aVR, but in the opposite direction. We would think that this vector should look negative in aVR, and it does!Now, let’s switch gears and talk about the chest leads, which essentially view the heart in a different plane. Looking down at the heart we have leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. Normally, the QRS complex is negative in leads V1 and V2, isoelectric in lead V3 and V4, which is called the transition zone, and positive in leads V5 and V6. If the transition zone shifts toward V1 or V2, and looks isoelectric instead of negative, it suggests that the heart may be rotated to the person’s right, which can happen if the right ventricle is hypertrophied. On the other hand, if leads V5 or V6 look isoelectric instead of positive, it suggests that the heart may be rotated to the person’s left, which can happen if the left ventricle is hypertrophied.###SUMMARYAll right, let’s quickly recap. A normal heart’s axis is between -30 and +90 degrees. Right ventricular hypertrophy can cause the axis to be between +90 and +180, and can sometimes cause the V1 and V2 chest leads to appear isoelectric. Left ventricular hypertrophy can cause the axis to be between -30 and -90, and can sometimes cause the V5 and V6 chest leads to appear isoelectric. '],\n",
              "  18: ['“Baro-“ means pressure or stretch, so baroreceptors are special nerve cells or receptors that sense blood pressure, by the way that the walls of the blood vessels stretch. That information is sent from the baroreceptors to the brain to help keep blood pressure balanced. Alright, baroreceptors are actually groups of nerve endings located within the blood vessel walls. and they can be classified into two types based on their location: the arterial ones and the cardiopulmonary ones. The arterial baroreceptors can be found on the wall of the aortic arch as well as on the wall of the carotid sinus, which is basically a bulge of the internal carotid artery just above its split from the common carotid artery in the neck. In the aortic arch, these nerve endings join up to form the vagus, or tenth (X) cranial nerve, and in the carotid sinus, they form the glossopharyngeal, or ninth (IX) cranial nerve. Both of these cranial nerves travel up towards the brainstem, carrying information about the stretch they sense in the arteries. They synapse at the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, which then relays the information to the cardiovascular centers. The cardiovascular centers are areas in the lower one-third of the pons and medulla oblongata of the brainstem, responsible for the autonomic or involuntary control of the cardiac and vascular function. They do that by coordinating the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. There are two main cardiovascular centers - the first is the vasomotor control center, which controls the diameter of the blood vessels, using the sympathetic nerve fibers to cause vasoconstriction. The second is the cardiac control center, which is further divided into the cardiac accelerator and cardiac decelerator centers. The cardiac accelerator center speeds up the heart rate and increases cardiac contractility through the sympathetic outflow tract, while the cardiac decelerator center slows down the heart rate through the parasympathetic outflow tract. Notice that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system affect the heart rate, but that only the sympathetic system has an effect on the diameter of the blood vessels and the contractility of the heart muscle. This whole process is known as the baroreceptor reflex, or baroreflex in short, and takes place in seconds to minutes, allowing us to rapidly adjust our blood pressure. Okay, so, as blood pulses through the carotid sinus and the aortic arch, the arterial walls get stretched out and in response, the baroreceptors start firing more nerve impulses up to those cardiovascular centers. The higher the pressure, the higher the frequency of nerve impulses. So, let’s say you’re running to catch the bus and your blood pressure rises. The increased pressure stretches the walls of the aortic arch and the carotid sinus, and the baroreceptors start firing at an increased frequency. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve carry that increased signal to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. To bring the pressure back down to normal, these centers inhibit the sympathetic and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous systems. Specifically, the vasomotor center decreases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system. In other words, the arterioles dilate, decreasing total peripheral arterial resistance, and there’s decreased constriction of veins, which allows blood to pool in the periphery rather than returning to the heart. Decreased venous return means there’s less preload - less diastolic filling of the heart - and that also decreases cardiac output. Meanwhile, remember that the cardiac accelerator center is also inhibited, reducing the sympathetic effect on the heart, and letting the heart work slower and less forcefully, in other words decreasing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again slows down the heart rate. Combined, these effects result in a decreased cardiac output (CO). Since blood pressure (BP), roughly equals cardiac output (CO) times total peripheral resistance (TPR), the decrease in cardiac output CO and the decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) means that blood pressure (BP) will decrease back down to normal as well. Hopefully, by that point, you’ve made the bus! On the flip side, let’s say that you’re in a terrible traumatic accident and start losing a lot of blood, causing your blood pressure to fall. The decreased pressure causes the walls of the aortic arch and carotid sinus to become less stretched, and the baroreceptors start firing less frequently. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve carry that decreased signal to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. To bring the pressure back up to normal, these centers stimulate the sympathetic and inhibit the parasympathetic nervous systems. Specifically, the vasomotor center increases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system. In other words, the arterioles narrow, increasing total peripheral arterial resistance, and there’s increased constriction of veins, which returns more blood to the heart rather than allowing it to pool in the periphery. Increased venous return means there’s more preload, and that also increases cardiac output. Meanwhile, remember that the cardiac accelerator center is also stimulated, increasing the sympathetic effect on the heart, and letting the heart work faster and more forcefully, in other words increasing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is deactivated, reducing the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again speeds up the heart rate. Combined, these effects result in an increased cardiac output (CO) and an increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR) which raises the blood pressure (BP) back to normal. In this case, these changes can save your life. Now, the other type of baroreceptors, called cardiopulmonary baroreceptors, are embedded within the walls of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery and veins. These are all relatively low-pressure areas, so the stretch of the walls mainly depends on the blood volume flowing through, or the “fullness” of these vessels. This is why these baroreceptors are mainly responsible for the regulation of blood volume and are also known as low- pressure or volume baroreceptors. If the blood volume increases, the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors start firing more frequently through the vagus nerve towards the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. These centers then send signals toward the heart, increasing its rate and, thus, the cardiac output. Increased cardiac output means more blood reaches the kidneys, so more water and sodium can get excreted, in an attempt to lower blood volume. This is called the Bainbridge reflex. In addition, when cardiopulmonary baroreceptors sense high blood volume, they also send their signal via the vagus nerve to the hypothalamus of the brain, telling it to reduce the production of vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone. This results in decreased water reabsorption from the kidney, letting more water get lost in the urine. Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors also stimulate the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide which comes from atrial muscle cells. ANP causes renal arterioles to dilate, allowing them to receive and filter even more blood, while also inhibiting water and sodium reabsorption. On the other hand, if the volume of blood decreases, cardiopulmonary baroreceptors get less stretched - reversing all of the effects. The heart rate slows down, more antidiuretic hormone is made, while less atrial natriuretic peptide is made. All this results in less water and sodium excretion, which helps restore blood volume. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, arterial baroreceptors are located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, and respond to blood pressure changes, sending information through the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to cardiovascular centers in the pons and medulla. These, in turn, through the autonomic nervous system, modify total peripheral resistance and cardiac output. Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors are found in the low-pressure regions of the heart and pulmonary vessels and regulate blood volume by influencing water excretion by the kidneys.'],\n",
              "  19: ['“Chemo-“ refers to the chemical composition of the blood, so chemoreceptors are special nerve cells or receptors that sense changes in the chemical composition of the blood. That information is sent from the chemoreceptors to the brain to help keep the cardiovascular and respiratory systems balanced. Alright, according to their location, chemoreceptors can be classified into two types: peripheral and central ones. Now, the peripheral chemoreceptors are so named because they live outside the brain. They are actually tiny bodies, or clusters of nerve cells and include the aortic body which sits along wall of the aortic arch, and the carotid body which is located at the point where each common carotid artery splits in the internal & external carotid arteries, running alongside the neck. Both the aortic and carotid bodies are bathed in arterial blood- and they carefully monitor changes in the concentration or partial pressure of oxygen, PO2 for short, but also in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2 for short, as well as the concentration of hydrogen ions, which determines blood pH. The aortic body sends this information along to the vagus, or tenth (X) cranial nerve, and the carotid body sends this information along to the glossopharyngeal, or ninth (IX) cranial nerve. These two large nerves travel up towards the respiratory centers which are in the brainstem. The respiratory centers are groups of neurons, located in the pons and medulla oblongata, that are responsible for the autonomic or involuntary control of breathing. The respiratory centers also communicate with the cardiovascular centers. The cardiovascular centers are areas in the lower one-third of the pons and medulla oblongata of the brainstem, responsible for the autonomic or involuntary control of the cardiac and vascular function. They do that by coordinating the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. There are two main cardiovascular centers - the first is the vasomotor control center, which controls the diameter of the blood vessels, using the sympathetic nerve fibers to cause vasoconstriction. The second is the cardiac control center, which is further divided into the cardiac accelerator and cardiac decelerator centers. The cardiac accelerator center speeds up the heart rate and increases cardiac contractility through the sympathetic outflow tract, while the cardiac decelerator center slows down the heart rate through the parasympathetic outflow tract. Notice that both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system affect the heart rate, but that only the sympathetic system has an effect on the diameter of the blood vessels and the contractility of the heart muscle.  Okay, so, let’s say that you have hypoxemia, meaning a decrease in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, PO2, along with hypercapnia, an increase in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2, and acidemia, a decrease in blood pH. As blood pulses through the aortic arch and the common carotid, these changes get detected by the aortic and carotid bodies, which start firing more nerve impulses up through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves towards the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem. In response, the vasomotor center increases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, causing arterioles to narrow, raising the total peripheral arterial resistance. In addition, the vasomotor center limits blood flow to peripheral organs, like the muscles, to help conserve oxygen for the brain and heart, and decreases the metabolic rate to help reduce carbon dioxide production. There’s also increased constriction of veins, which returns more blood to the heart rather than allowing it to pool in the periphery. Increased venous return means there’s more preload, and that also increases cardiac output. Now another effect, is that the cardiac accelerator center gets inhibited, reducing the sympathetic effect on the heart, so that it can work slower and less forcefully, in other words decreasing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again slows down the heart rate. This last bit might seem counterintuitive, but stay tuned. Now, it turns out that peripheral chemoreceptors also send impulses through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves which reach the respiratory centers of the brainstem. And they cause you to suck in more oxygen and blow off more carbon dioxide, by getting the diaphragm and chest wall muscles to breathe faster and deeper. Now, this causes airways to get stretched, and that’s detected by another type of receptors, called pulmonary stretch receptors, which are located in the smooth muscles lining the trachea and central bronchi. Once stretched, these receptors start firing through the vagus nerve back to the pons and medulla, where they tell the respiratory centers to slow down. At the same time, though, they stimulate the cardiac accelerator center and, thus, the sympathetic effect on the heart, increasing the heart rate and contractility, while inhibiting the cardiac decelerator center and thus, the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which again helps the heart rate speed up. In other words, they reverse the direct effects that the peripheral chemoreceptors had on the cardiac centers. Ultimately, this makes the heart work faster and stronger, letting the cardiac output CO and blood pressure BP rise, which is essential to push more blood to the lungs, so that it gets supplied with oxygen and freed from the excess carbon dioxide. Now, peripheral chemoreceptors work in concert with the central chemoreceptors, which take their name from the fact that they are a part of the central nervous system, particularly of the brain. Central chemoreceptors are clusters of neurons packed together in the ventral or frontal surface of the medulla oblongata, at the base of the brain, right next to the respiratory centers themselves. The central chemoreceptors are bathed in cerebrospinal fluid, and they sample that fluid to assess for changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2 and pH. That’s different from the peripheral chemoreceptors, which are primarily sensitive to changes in the partial pressure of oxygen or PO2. When the partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2 rises in the blood, carbon dioxide molecules rapidly diffuse across the blood-brain barrier and build up into the cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid is mainly composed of water, so carbon dioxide (CO2) binds to water (H2O) molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), and that rapidly breaks down into hydrogen (H+) ions and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).CO2 + H2O    <->     H2CO3      <->      H+ + HCO3-.As hydrogen H+ ions build up, too, the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid starts to drop. So, both the increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2 and the decreased pH, trigger the central chemoreceptors to stimulate the nearby respiratory centers to increase the respiratory drive. Now, what makes central chemoreceptors special, is that, due to their location, they are also influenced by changes in blood flow to the brain. Imagine, for example, that there is a large mass inside the head which raises the intracranial pressure, squashing the blood vessels heading in and out of the brain and causing brain ischemia. This means all that carbon dioxide CO2 that gets released by the brain cells as a byproduct of their metabolic processes, can’t escape through blood flow, so inevitably, starts accumulating cerebrospinal spinal, or CSF, also decreasing its pH. Once again, this get detected by the central chemoreceptors, which, via the vasomotor center, leads to arteriolar and venous constriction, redirecting more blood flow to the brain. That increases total peripheral resistance (TPR) which raises the blood pressure (BP), helping the blood pressure to stay higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure so that blood can continue to flow to the brain. This increase in blood pressure in response to increased intracranial pressure is called the Cushing reaction, named after the neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, peripheral chemoreceptors include the aortic and carotid bodies, which respond primarily to decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen PO2, and, secondarily, to increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2, and decreases in blood pH, sending information through the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to vasomotor and cardiac centers in the pons and medulla. These, in turn, through sympathetic stimulatiom, increase total peripheral resistance and cardiac output, raising blood pressure. Central chemoreceptors are found in the medulla and are more sensitive to increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO2, and decreases in the pH, which again, through the vasomotor center, stimulate sympathetic vasoconstriction raising blood pressure.'],\n",
              "  20: ['According to the world health organization, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, as well as in the US. Of those, a large proportion are caused by heart attacks, also known as acute myocardial infarctions, or just myocardial infarctions, sometimes just called MI.   The word infarction means that some area of tissue has died due to a lack of blood flow, and therefore a lack of oxygen. “Myo” refers to the muscle, and “cardial” refers to the heart tissue. So with a heart attack, or MI, you have death of heart muscle cells because of a lack in blood flow, a process called necrosis. Now the heart’s main job is to pump blood to your body’s tissues right? Well, the heart also needs blood, and so it also pumps blood to itself, using the coronary circulation. The coronary circulation is this system of small arteries and veins that help keep the heart cells supplied with fresh oxygen. Heart attacks happen when these small arteries become blocked and stop supplying blood to the heart tissue, and if this happens for long enough, heart tissue dies.  Almost all heart attacks are ultimately a result of endothelial cell dysfunction, which relates to anything that irritates or inflames the slippery inner lining of the artery—the tunica intima. One classic irritant are the toxins found in tobacco which float around in the blood and damage these cells. That damage then becomes a site for atherosclerosis, a type of coronary artery disease where deposits of fat, cholesterol, proteins, calcium, and white blood cells build up and start to block blood flow to the heart tissue. This mound of stuff has two parts to it, the soft cheesy-textured interior and the hard outer shell which is called the fibrous cap. Collectively this whole thing’s ominously called plaque. Usually, though, it takes years for plaque to build up, and this slow blockage only partially blocks the coronary arteries, and so even though less blood makes it to heart tissue, there’s still blood. Heart attacks happen when there’s a sudden complete blockage or occlusion of a coronary artery—so let’s see how that can happen. Since these plaques sit right in the lumen of the blood vessel, they’re constantly being stressed by mechanical forces from blood flow, and interestingly it’s often the smaller plaques with softer caps rather than the larger ones with harder caps that are especially prone to break or get ripped off. Once that happens the inner cheesy filling which remember is this mix of fat, cholesterol, proteins, calcium, and white blood cells, is thrombogenic, and this means that it tends to form clots very quickly. So platelets, or blood-clotting components in the blood, flow by and get excited; and they adhere to the exposed cheesy material. In addition to piling up, the platelets also release chemicals that enhance the clotting process. Now this happens super fast, think about how quickly a small cut stops bleeding, that’s a very similar process—it happens in a matter of minutes, right? And now that coronary artery is fully occluded.So now let’s change views a bit, If we take a slice of the heart like this, this side being posterior, or back, and this being anterior, or the front, with the left and right ventricles here, and then we have the three most commonly blocked arteries—the left anterior descending, or LAD which supplies blood to the anterior wall and septum of the left ventricle which accounts for 40-50% of cases, the right coronary artery, or the RCA which covers the posterior wall, septum and papillary muscles of the left ventricle—accounts for about 30-40% of cases, and finally, the left circumflex artery, or LCX which supplies to the lateral wall of the left ventricle —about 15-20% of cases. Notice that the majority of these areas supply the left ventricle—most heart attacks therefore involve the left ventricle, where the right ventricle and both atria—the upper chamber—aren’t as often affected.  Each of these areas is called the artery’s zone of perfusion. And, if we take a closer look at one of these zones, we’ll see that basically you’ve got the endocardium, which is the smooth membrane on the inside of the heart, and then the myocardium, all the heart muscle, and then, the epicardium, the outer surface of the heart, which is where the coronary arteries live. Let’s say the LAD gets blocked, the area of perfusion is now at serious risk, and within about a minute, the muscle cells in this zone don’t see enough oxygen and become ischemic, and the muscle layer’s ability to contract is severely reduced. This initial stage is extremely sensitive, since the ischemic damage to cells in the perfusion zone is potentially reversible. After about 20-40 minutes, though, damage starts to become irreversible and the cells start to die, and this zone changes to a zone of necrosis, or dead tissue. Once lost, these cells will never return or regrow—that’s why quickly identifying and treating an MI quickly is super important.  The first area affected is the inner third of the myocardium, since it’s farthest from the coronary artery and the last area to receive blood, and it’s subject to higher pressures from inside the heart. If the blockage suddenly lyses or breaks down and blood flow returns, sometimes patients’ damage will be limited to the inner third, and this would be called a subendocardial infarct. An ECG, or electrocardiogram, done at this point typically shows an ST-segment depression, or in other words, it doesn’t show ST segment elevation, so sometimes we call this an NSTEMI which stands for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.Other causes of this sort of subendocardial infarcts would be severe atherosclerosis and hypotension—anything that ultimately leads to poor perfusion of the heart tissue. After about 3 to 6 hours, though, the zone of necrosis extends through the entire wall thickness, called a transmural infarct, which this time shows up as ST-segment elevation on ECG, which is why they’re sometimes called STEMIs, or ST elevation myocardial infarctions. So the difference between NSTEMIs and STEMIs is that NSTEMIs don’t have ST-segment elevation, and these are caused by partial infarct of the wall, whereas STEMIs have ST-segment elevation and involve the whole wall thickness.  Patients that have an MI will most commonly have severe and crushing chest pain or pressure, that might radiate up to the left arm or jaw, they might have diaphoresis or sweating, nausea, fatigue, and dyspnea. All of these are either a direct result of an end-organ like the heart or the brain not getting enough perfusion—so think chest pain and dizziness. Or from the sympathetic response from the body to help the heart work harder and preserve blood pressure—so think sweating and clammy skin. Many people also have referred pain where the nerves in the heart are irritated, but that pain can be felt in the jaw, shoulder, arm, or back instead.   In addition to an ECG, labs can be very useful in diagnosing an MI. When there’s been irreversible damage to heart cells, their membranes become damaged and the proteins and enzymes inside escape, and can enter the bloodstream. Three key ones are troponin I, Troponin T, and CK-MB, which is a combination of creatine kinase enzymes M and B. d Both troponin I and T levels can be elevated in the blood within 2-4 hours after infarction, and usually peak around 48 hours, but stay elevated for 7-10 days. CK-MB starts to rise 2-4 hours after infarction, peaks around 24 hours, and returns to normal after 48 hours. Since CK-MB returns to normal more quickly, it can be useful to diagnose reinfarction, a second infarction that happens after 48 hours but before troponin levels go back to normal. A second heart attack happens following 10% of MIs.  A major complication with MIs are arrhythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms, with the highest risk being immediately following an MI, since the damage or injury can disrupt how the cells conduct electrical signals. Kind of along the same lines, depending on how much contractile or muscle tissue is affected, patients’ hearts might not be able to pump enough blood to the body, resulting in cardiogenic shock. In the days following an infarction, the tissue around the infarcted area becomes inflamed and is invaded by neutrophils, which can lead to pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium. In the next couple weeks, macrophages invade the tissue, and the healing process begins with the formation of granulation tissue, which is new connective tissue that’s yellow and soft. At this phase, the tissue’s most at risk of myocardial rupture. After 2 weeks to several months, the cardiac tissue scarring process finishes, and the resulting tissue becomes grayish-white in color. Since the scar tissue doesn’t help pump blood, over time the remaining heart muscle can grow or change shape to try and compensate for these lost cells and pump harder, but they ultimately continue to fail, which can lead to heart failure.   Now a potentially life-saving treatment that can be performed immediately following an MI, is fibrinolytic therapy, which uses medications to break down fibrin in blood clots. An angioplasty might also be done, which is a minimally invasive endovascular procedure where a deflated balloon inserted into the blockage then inflated to open the artery up. And finally a percutaneous coronary intervention might also be performed, where a tiny catheter is used to place a stent in the coronary artery to physically open up a blood vessel. Each of these focuses on re-establishing blood flow to the the dying heart heart cells—since time is tissue. If early enough following blockage, some of these cells that haven’t entered into the irreversible stage can be salvaged and saved, while the others will be destroyed and removed. This can improve both short and long-term function as well as prevent further damage and reduce the overall zone of necrosis.   Now an important complication of re-establishing perfusion, or reperfusion therapy, is reperfusion injury, where tissue is damaged by returning blood flow. And, this is thought to happen because of a couple mechanisms. First, blood flowing back to cells brings this influx of calcium, and since calcium leads to muscle contraction, the irreversibly damaged cells contract, and since they’ve been irreversibly damaged, they get stuck like that and can’t relax. This shows up on histology as this characteristic contraction band necrosis. Also though, blood brings along oxygen, right? Yeah it does. But, that oxygen, paradoxically, can actually lead to more cellular damage. The conditions in an ischemic heart seem to cause an increased conversion of the returning oxygen to reactive oxygen species, which go on to damage more heart cells.  In addition to reestablishing blood flow though, there are a number of medications that might be given in the acute setting including antiplatelet meds like aspirin, anticoagulants like heparin, nitrates which relax the coronary arteries and help lower preload, beta blockers that slow down the heart rate and thereby cardiac demand, pain medication to help relieve the discomfort, and statins which help improve a patient’s lipid profile. Now there are many individual factors to consider when it comes to acute management of a myocardial infarction, and of course many long term issues to consider as well—the most important of which is to address the underlying risk factors like an improved diet and quitting smoking.   ###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap… heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction, or MI, is the death of heart muscle cells due to the lack of blood flow, most commonly caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. The most common symptoms of MI include crushing chest pain or pressure that might radiate up to the left arm or jaw, sweating, nausea, and dyspnea. Treatment of MI includes re-establishing blood flow using medications, angioplasty, or percutaneous coronary intervention. Underlying risk factors should be addressed for long term management.

              "  21: ['Vascular refers to the blood vessels, and peripheral means the outer limits or edge of something, which in peripheral vascular disease refers to any vessels that aren’t supplying the heart or the brain, like ones in the legs, arms, or other organs. Peripheral vascular disease happens when one of these arteries becomes narrowed, which reduces blood flow; this often affects the limbs.Peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, usually involves the arteries, so sometimes it’s also referred to as peripheral artery disease or PAD. PVD is usually caused by a blockage, called organic PVD, that is most commonly created by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of lipids and fibrous material just under the inner lining of the blood vessel, called the tunica intima. When plaque builds up, it narrows the artery, which reduces perfusion to whatever tissue it tends to supply; this buildup usually happens over the course of many years. However, the vessel could be blocked by an embolus, which can happen suddenly if a blood clot from some upstream artery lodges in a peripheral artery; this clot would obviously stop blood flow from getting to the tissue the vessel supplies.   Besides organic PVDs, there are also functional PVDs. With functional PVDs, blood vessels stop blood flow by changing diameter, such as with vasospasms, where the vessel constricts and blood flow is reduced. This type of PVD is usually short term, and can come and go.  The arteries supplying the legs are the most commonly affected vessels in peripheral vascular disease. When less blood gets to the muscle tissue in the legs, the tissue receives less oxygen and becomes ischemic. Ischemic cells release adenosine, a type of signaling molecule, which is thought to affect nerves in these areas; this is felt as pain. This pain in the legs is often referred to as claudication. Sometimes, even though blood flow is narrowed with PVD, when a person is at rest, there’s enough of blood to meet the tissue’s demands; thus, people are often asymptomatic during rest.   However, if the person is walking or exercising, then the leg muscles start to work harder and demand more oxygen; demand becomes greater than what’s supplied, which causes the claudication, or pain. The location of the pain is a clue to which artery is involved. If it’s in the hips and the buttocks, think of lower aorta or iliac. If it’s the thigh, think of the iliac or common femoral artery. For the upper 2/3 of the calf, think of the superficial femoral artery; for the lower ⅓ of the calf, think of the popliteal artery. Finally, for the foot, think of the tibial or peroneal artery.   Other symptoms include leg or foot wounds, or ulcers, that don’t heal up normally, and color changes of focal areas of the skin. For example, if the leg’s been affected, the foot might turn pale white when it’s raised; this “elevation pallor” happens because gravity works against blood flowing to the lower extremities, which already has a hard time getting through the narrowed artery.   Likewise, the foot might turn red when it’s lowered, which is called dependent rubor, because gravity is working with the blood flow in this direction. We can see that gravity seriously starts to affect blood flow in the affected arteries. As the arterial blockage gets bigger, less and less blood gets to the tissues, which can lead to more serious complications. First, “rest pain” describes a continuous burning or pain in the forefoot and toes when the legs are elevated; this pain is relieved when the limbs are lowered, such as by hanging the feet over the bed or walking around the room, because doing so allows more blood to get down to the foot. If the blockage is severe enough, the limb might be at risk of gangrene, or death of the tissue, because if deprived of oxygen for long enough, the cells can actually die, or necrose. If this happens, the dead tissue would likely have to be removed, and in some cases, the limb would have to be amputated.  The major risk factors and causes of peripheral vascular disease are the same as those for atherosclerosis because they are similar processes. Remember, atherosclerosis in the neck arteries can cause a stroke, and if involved in the coronary arteries, can cause a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Smoking seems to be the biggest contributor to PVD. Other diseases and conditions that are also linked to a higher risk of PVD include: diabetes; dyslipidemia, or an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood; and hypertension.  Diagnosing PVD usually involves listening to the pulse in the iliac arteries of the legs with a stethoscope. Because that artery has been narrowed, it can make a whooshing sound, called a bruit. Another test that can be done is a doppler ultrasound, which is a noninvasive way of visualizing blood flow. The most common test to diagnose PVD is the ankle-brachial index, or ABI, where blood pressure is taken in the ankle and in the arm, and then compared. PVD is typically diagnosed if the systolic blood pressure in the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure in the arm is less than 0.9. In general, claudication is often seen in people with an ABI between 0.4 and 0.9. Rest pain is likely present if an ABI is between 0.2 and 0.4. Tissue loss, ulcers, and gangrene are likely if an ABI is between 0 to 0.4.  Treating PVD often requires significant lifestyle changes that address the underlying risk factors, such as quitting smoking, adopting healthy eating habits, and exercising regularly. Sometimes in addition to these changes, people with PVD will also get certain medications that aim to reduce the likelihood of blood clotting and obstruction of the blood vessels.  Surgical intervention, like angioplasty or bypass surgery, is rarely needed. ###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap…. Peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, refers to narrowing of a blood vessel, usually an artery that does not supply the heart or brain. PVD can be organic, where the narrowing is caused by a blockage, or functional, where the blood vessel are constricted. PVD causes reduction in blood flow to the tissue supplied by the artery, resulting in tissue ischemia, gangrene, and necrosis. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, medication to reduce clotting, or rarely surgery.'],\n",
              "  22: ['The word “aneurysm” comes from the Greek word aneurysma, meaning “dilation.” This  makes sense because aneurysms are defined as abnormal dilations in a blood vessel. A bulge in a blood vessel is officially labelled as an aneurysm when the diameter of the bulge is approximately one and a half times larger than the normal diameter of the blood vessel.Aneurysms can happen to any blood vessel in your body, including the aorta, the femoral artery, the iliac artery, the popliteal artery, and the cerebral arteries. They can also happen in your veins too, but those are less common as blood pressure in veins is much, much lower than in the arteries.   There are two major categories of aneurysms: true aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. In true aneurysms, all the layers of the blood vessel wall dilate together. True aneurysms that balloon out symmetrically on all sides of the blood vessel are called fusiform aneurysms, whereas asymmetrically shaped aneurysms balloon out on  one side of the blood vessel. This asymmetrical shape usually happens because for some reason one side of the blood vessel wall experiences higher blood pressure than the rest of the vessel wall, or because the wall was weaker on one side to begin with. Asymmetrical true aneurysms can be called either “saccular” or “berry” aneurysms. Pseudoaneurysms, on the other hand, are like false aneurysms because they are not actually aneurysms at all. They are caused by a small hole in your blood vessel which allows blood to leak out of the vessel and form a pool of blood that looks like a fusiform or berry aneurysm depending on where the hole is and its size. The blood pools because the surrounding tissues act as walls that contain the blood in one spot.Arterial aneurysms occur most commonly in the aorta with about 60% of true aortic aneurysms happening in the abdominal section of the aorta, and the other 40% happening in the thoracic section. Of all the abdominal aortic aneurysms, you can find about 95% of them just below the point where the renal arteries branch off from the abdominal aorta but above the aortic bifurcation. This is because there is naturally less elastin[a] in the walls of this section of the aorta.  Aneurysms are caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, so anything (really anything!), that causes the wall to weaken can cause an aneurysm. When a blood vessel wall weakens, it struggles to contain the pressure of the blood pushing against the walls so the diameter of the blood vessel lumen increases. On top of this, pressure on the blood vessel walls increases as the diameter of the lumen also increases, thanks to LaPlace’s law. This makes the aneurysm diameter even bigger, creating a cycle of continuous bulging. You’ve likely experienced this when you blow up a balloon. The first breath into the balloon is tough, but the next several breaths are pretty easy. This positive feedback loop is why aneurysms usually get bigger over time.  So what underlying conditions might weaken the wall of blood vessels? Well one way is if all the layers of those blood vessel walls don’t receive oxygen. Typically, the cells of the vessel walls are able to get oxygen from blood as it flows by. However, in the first section of the aorta, where the walls are super thick and muscular in order to handle all that blood pressure coming from the heart, the cells need to have their own set of blood vessels that supply the tunica media and the tunica externa. We call these special blood vessels vasa vasorum.   In hypertension, the vasa vasorum can develop hyaline arteriolosclerosis, narrowing their lumen, and causing ischemia. This leads to atrophy of the smooth muscle of the tunica media, and overall all, weakening in the aortic wall.  The same thing can happen in blood vessels without vasa vasorum if we have a bunch of plaque building up on the tunica intima thanks to our friendly neighbourhood atherosclerosis. Oxygen just can’t penetrate all the vessel’s walls. You see this type of aneurysm often in the abdominal aorta, where blood pressure is high and the aorta walls are nourished by passing blood. If you think about this it’s no wonder, then, why both aneurysms and atherosclerosis share similar risk factors: usually people who are male, who are over the age of 60, who have hypertension, and who smoke.If we look at tertiary syphilis, it affects the vasa vasorum as syphilis causes inflammation in the tunica intima of the vasa vasorum (which again are those blood vessels that deliver oxygen to the thick walls of larger blood vessels). This ultimately leads to a narrower lumen and restricts blood supply to the vessel walls of the thoracic aorta, causing atrophy. By the way, the name for this vasa vasorum inflammation is endarteritis obliterans. If you were to look at the vasa vasorum in tertiary syphilis, you’d see the inflammation causes fibrosis and scarring on the walls creating this cool to look at, but less cool to have, tree-bark like texture.Other bacterial infections can also cause aneurysms, which we label as mycotic aneurysms. The bacteria from an infection somewhere else in the body can break off from the main infection and travel around in the blood. Usually these embolic bacteria will get stuck in the intracranial arteries, visceral arteries, or the arteries feeding the arms and legs. There, the bacteria enter and weaken the blood vessel walls leading to, you guessed it, an aneurysm. Some of the bacteria that commonly cause mycotic aneurysms are, and these can be tricky to pronounce so bare with me, Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anything in the Salmonella species. You’ll also see mycotic aneurysms are a complication of infective endocarditis. However, infection leading to aneurysm is not limited to just bacteria. Infection from the fungi Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucor are also a common cause of mycotic aneurysms.Genetic disorders affecting your body’s ability to properly form connective tissue like fibrillin or collagen also weaken the blood vessel walls. For example, people with Marfan syndrome have weakened blood vessel walls because the elastic properties found within fibrillin is impaired, and people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are more likely to develop aneurysms because their ability to form collagen proteins is disrupted.  Alrighty then, so intact aneurysms are usually okay, and don’t cause any symptoms. I say usually because the bulging blood vessel can compress other organs or vessels around it. If an aneurysm compressed a major vein like the inferior or superior vena cava, it could decrease the amount of blood returning to the heart.   Usually though, the big worry with aneurysms is the possibility that they might explode, or more like rupture, but it’s more fun to say explode. When an aneurysm ruptures, it’s like having a water main break: blood is spewing out from the hole in the blood vessel and less blood is flowing downstream to the cells that need it, which causes ischemia in that downstream tissue.  In thoracic aneurysms specifically, a very serious complication can occur if the aneurysm is right above the aortic valve. As the aneurysm dilates, it pulls on the walls around the aortic valve preventing the aortic valve from closing properly.This allows blood from within the aorta to flow back into the ventricle during ventricular diastole. This particular condition is called aortic insufficiency, and can also cause a high-pitched, brassy like cough because the left recurrent laryngeal nerve which wraps around the aorta is stretched by the expanding diameter of the aorta. I don’t have that audio clip for that brassy cough sound, but it’s pretty distinct when you hear it.Moving on to the brain. If an aneurysm ruptures in the brain, blood will pool into the subarachnoid space putting pressure on the brain tissue and irritating the meninges, which cause symptoms like a very sudden and intense headache, and the inability for someone to flex their neck forward. Another point on the list of terrible things aneurysms can cause is blood clots. As blood flows past the aneurysm, some of the blood might pull over into the extra lumen space caused by the aneurysm itself. This blood isn’t being pushed along the blood vessel as quickly as the rest of the blood, and when blood stays still for too long, it likes to clot. Given enough time, the blood clot might become so big it blocks off the entire blood vessel causing tissue ischemia.It could break into smaller pieces called emboli and get wedged in a smaller blood vessel, also causing ischemia.   As an aside, it’s kind of nifty that the clotting property of blood is really useful to stop blood from leaking out of our blood vessels, but it just also happens to be really really deadly if it stops the blood from moving altogether. Honestly, blood coagulation could be the plot for the third installment of the Speed movies.Okay, back on track. Abdominal aortic aneurysms sometimes have signs and symptoms, and sometimes they don’t, even if the aneurysm has ruptured. Really severe pain in the left flank (which includes the abdomen, chest, lower back, and the groin), a pulsating mass that is in time with the heartbeat somewhere in this painful region, and hypotension occur in about 50% of aneurysms that have ruptured and are considered the classical signs of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Thoracic aortic aneurysms usually don’t have any symptoms, although sometimes they can cause severe chest, back, and abdominal pain.Aneurysms can be asymptomatic, and are sometimes diagnosed incidentally when an individual gets an imaging study for another reason. Usually they’re seen best on an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. If an aneurysm is present and large enough to cause risk to an individual, it can be treated surgically.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap... Aneurysms are blood-filled bulges that form in weakened areas of the blood vessel walls. Left untreated, aneurysms can burst, causing uncontrolled internal bleeding or excessive blood clotting. Based on the size and location of an aneurysm, surgical treatment may be necessary.'],\n",
              "  23: ['An aortic dissection is where part of the tunica intima (which is the endothelial, or the innermost layer of a blood vessel) of the aorta is ripped off. What happens is a tear in the tunica intima of the aorta forms, and the high-pressured blood flowing through the aorta begins to tunnel between the tunica intima and the tunica media, separating the two layers. This is widely accepted as an unideal situation.Now as the high-pressured blood continues to shear more and more of the tunica intima off the tunica media, blood starts to pool between the two layers, increasing the outside diameter of the blood vessel. The area where blood collects between the tunica intima and the media is called a false lumen, and the true lumen is the regular lumen of the blood vessel.Since high pressure is a cause of aortic dissection, it’s no surprise that the aorta is the prime target for this problem. So what causes aortic dissections? Well, chronic hypertension is the major cause, whether the hypertension is caused by stress or from increased blood plasma volume like in pregnancy. Blood vessel coarctation, which is the narrowing of a blood vessel, also can cause  dissection. Aortic dissections most often happen in the first 10 cm of the the aorta closest to the heart. In order for an aortic dissection to occur, an underlying condition usually has to exist that weakens the aorta’s wall. Connective tissue disorders like Marfan’s and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause a dissection, as well as a decreased blood flow to the vasa vasorum. Aneurysms can be a cause of aortic dissection as well, and incidentally dissection can also cause aneurysms because again, the dissection weakens the blood vessel wall.In other words, weak walls can lead to outpouching of the blood vessel or a break in the tunica intima, and both of these weaken the walls further.Aortic dissections cause a whole wack load of other problems too. A lot of complications are related to where the blood in the false lumen flows. The blood could flow back up the aorta to the heart and enter the heart’s pericardial space, filling it with blood and causing pericardial tamponade, a really really bad and potentially fatal situation. The blood flowing through the false lumen could also puncture a hole through the tunica media and tunica externa and bleed into the mediastinum, which would kill you really fast cause that’s a lot of blood leaving the vascular system quickly. The tunneling blood could also puncture a hole in the tunica intima and return into the true lumen which isn’t great but hey all things considered, it could be worse.Yet another possibility is the blood could continue to tunnel between the tunica intima and the tunica media until it reaches another artery that branches off the aorta, like the renal arteries or the subclavian arteries. The blood in the false lumen can put pressure on these branching arteries decreasing blood flow to the kidneys and arms, causing a whole new mess to deal with. The main symptoms of aortic dissection are sharp chest pains that often radiate to the back. A person might also develop weak pulses in downstream arteries like the brachial or femoral arteries or sometimes there may be differences in blood pressure between the left and right arm. An aortic dissection is an emergency, because it can lead to hypotension, or low blood pressure as well as shock if there’s rupture and significant blood loss.On a chest X-ray, there’s typically a widened aorta. More sensitive imaging techniques that are commonly used include a transesophageal echocardiogram, which is where an ultrasound probe is passed through the esophagus to obtain a clear picture of the aorta. There’s also CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography - both of which look closely at the blood vessels. An aortic dissection needs to be treated immediately. Often this is done surgically, where a surgeon takes out as much of the dissected aorta as possible and blocks the entry of blood into the wall of the aorta. The aortic wall is then reconstructed with synthetic graft, and sometimes that graft is propped open with a wire mesh stent. Beyond surgery, blood pressure medications, like beta blockers may be given to reduce blood pressure. ###SUMMARYAlright … as a quick recap. An aortic dissection is where blood tunnels between the tunica intima and the tunica media, separating the two layers and creating a false lumen. This a rare condition that is most often happens with a history of high blood pressure, connective tissues disorders and aneurysms. An aortic dissection can lead to emergency situations like cardiac tamponade and shock and should be treated immediately. '],\n",
              "  24: ['Kawasaki disease isn’t related to the motorcycle and engine company, other than that Japan was where the disease was first described and where the company was founded. Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, or an inflammation of the blood vessels, that mostly affects the coronary arteries, but can also affect any large- or medium-sized arteries. With Kawasaki disease, the immune system attacks the arteries. It’s not entirely known why this happens, although some theories suggest it has an infectious cause; autoimmune reactions and genetic predisposition probably play a part as well. Whatever the case, when the endothelial cells in the blood vessels are attacked, they become damaged, exposing the underlying collagen and tissue factor found in the middle layer of the blood vessel, or the tunica media. This leads to a few serious problems. First, these exposed materials increase the chance of blood coagulation. When blood coagulates, it forms clots that can block blood flow in the coronary arteries, leading to ischemia of the heart muscle. Secondly, damaged endothelial cells in coronary arteries mean weak artery walls, which can lead to coronary aneurysms. These aneurysms form because fibrin is deposited into the blood vessel wall as part of the healing process. Fibrin makes the vessel stiffer, less elastic, and unable to gently stretch with high arterial pressures; therefore, the arteries develop permanent bulges that we call aneurysms. Aneurysms 8mm or larger are at the most risk of rupturing, which reduces blood flow to the heart; this causes ischemia, and potentially myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Thirdly, in some cases, this fibrosis doesn’t lead to aneurysms; instead, fibrosis of the blood vessels makes the vessel walls thicker, which reduces the lumen diameter and restricts blood flow. If blood flow is restricted or reduced, again, the heart might become ischemic, leading to heart attack.  Kawasaki disease is most commonly seen in infants and children under five years old, and is more likely to affect boys. This disease is self-limited, which means that the inflammation will resolve after six to eight weeks, but if we left it untreated, there is a 20-25% risk of  developing the heart complications mentioned earlier. We rarely see any cardiac symptoms in the first few weeks, unless the patient has an underlying heart condition already; otherwise, cardiac symptoms typically evolve later. These are the classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease: conjunctivitis with limbus sparing, which means red eyes with a white margin right around the iris; a rash that might extend across multiple parts of the body, which starts polymorphous, but later desquamates, or flakes off; adenopathy, or enlarged lymph nodes, especially concerning the cervical lymph nodes; a strawberry tongue, which is when the top layer of cells on the tongue slough off, giving the tongue a very red, strawberry-like appearance; their mouth and throat may also look very red; their lips might become dry and cracked; their hands and feet might develop a rash and swell; and finally, they might have five or more days of high fever that typically doesn’t resolve with antipyretics. Just remember that these patients C-R-A-S-H and burn.Now, there isn’t a specific test to diagnose Kawasaki disease, but there are a number of lab tests that can provide clues. At the beginning of the disease, many patients are anemic and have an increased number of white blood cells with a “shift to the left,” which means that there are more immature white blood cells than normal. They’ll also have an increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and increased liver enzymes; these are all good clues telling us that some sort of inflammation is happening. Microscopic urinalysis will show mononuclear white blood cells in the urine without evidence of bacteria. After a few weeks, the patient’s platelet count also typically rises. That was a lot of tests, but one last test that we’d want to do is an echocardiogram to take a look at the coronary artery and the heart muscle, to see if any of the heart complications we talked about earlier are happening.Kawasaki disease is diagnosed based on a combination of patient symptoms and lab tests. In order for Kawasaki disease to be diagnosed, patients need four of the five CRASH symptoms we talked about earlier, in addition to a fever that lasts five or more days. Sometimes, however, patients don’t meet this these[a] strict criteria. Vasculitis in the coronary arteries is a definitive sign that the patient has Kawasaki disease, but you probably wouldn’t want to wait to find that out, right? People who don’t perfectly meet all the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease are sometimes classified as having incomplete Kawasaki disease. There are guidelines in place to help healthcare providers figure out if they should treat these atypical cases as Kawasaki disease or not, but just keep in mind that it’s possible to have cases that don’t meet all the clinical diagnostic requirements.   Treating Kawasaki disease is also helpful diagnostically, because if the therapy works, then it also reassures you that the right diagnosis was made. The main treatment is to give IVIG, which is an antibody taken from other individuals. It’s thought that this actually helps to calm down the immune system and reduce inflammation. We also give ASA, otherwise known as acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin, because aspirin inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase, which prevents platelets from aggregating together. Wait a second! There should be alarm bells going off, right? We’re not supposed to give aspirin to kids because they could develop Reye syndrome, which is encephalopathy and serious liver injury, and therefore bad news. Kawasaki’s disease is also bad news though, so we take the risk and monitor the child very carefully.   ###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap… Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis mostly affecting children where the immune system attacks arteries, damaging endothelial cells of blood vessels. The mnemonic “C-R-A-S-H and burn” summarizes its classic symptoms. The disease will resolve on its own, but left untreated it can lead to complications such as blood clots, coronary aneurysms, and ischemia. For this reason, it is treated with IVIG and aspirin.'],\n",
              "  25: ['Coarctation is a fancy way of saying “narrowing,” so a coarctation of the aorta means a narrowing of the aorta. If we look at the heart, we’ve got the right and left atria, the right and left ventricles, the pulmonary artery leaving the right ventricle to go to the lungs, and the aorta leaving the left ventricle to go to the body.   There are two forms of aortic coarctation to be familiar with: an “infant” form and an “adult” form. With the infant form, which accounts for about 70% of cases, the coarctation comes after the aortic arch, which branches off to the upper extremities and to the head, and before the ductus arteriosus. Now, you might be thinking, “Hey, what’s this ductus arteriosus thing doing here?” Well, typically this guy only exists during fetal development and closes after birth, but with infantile coarctation, the ductus arteriosus is usually still open, or patent, so there’s a patent ductus arteriosus. In fact, sometimes this form is also called preductal coarctation.  So, if we draw out a more simplified version of the heart, we’ve got deoxygenated blood coming into the right atrium that flows into the right ventricle. Now, as it’s pumped out of the pulmonary artery, it’s got two choices, right? One option is to go through the patent ductus arteriosus and continue down the aorta; the other option is to continue down the way it’s going. Well, since it’s higher pressure over here on the left side, you might think that the blood would say “thanks, but no thanks,” and keep going down the lower pressure pulmonary artery. Instead, this aortic coarctation adds a little twist. Since the spot right before the ductus arteriosus is narrower, blood flowing from the left side has a harder time going through, so actually there’s high pressure upstream of the coarctation, but low pressure downstream. So, what happens is that blood decides to go this way, through the patent ductus arteriosus and into the lower pressure area in the systemic circulation, and then continues down to the lower extremities, rather than the slightly higher pressure pulmonary artery. This gives you a real sense of exactly how much this coarctation reduces the pressure over on the systemic side.   Since deoxygenated blood is going to the lower extremities, infants typically present with lower extremity cyanosis, meaning a bluish or purplish discoloration of the lower limbs, which is often present even at birth. This is a really important thing to catch, because without intervention, these infants often don’t survive past the neonatal period. Infantile coarctation is something that happens during fetal development, and can occur on its own or can be associated with other congenital changes. It’s worth mentioning that it’s highly associated with Turner syndrome, a genetic abnormality where females only have one X chromosome instead of two.All right, this brings us to adult coarctation, which accounts for the other 30% of cases, and typically develops, well, as an adult. Compared to infantile coarctation, in this type there usually isn’t a patent ductus arteriosus; instead, it’s been long since closed off and is now known as the ligamentum arteriosum. The coarctation usually happens in adults just distal to this ligament. So, now there’s no mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, but just like in infantile coarctation, the pressure is increased before the coarctation, because blood has a harder time squeezing through this narrowed artery, and it’s going to be lower downstream from the coarctation.  This causes both upstream and downstream issues. Upstream issues include blood flow increases into the aortic branches, and thus blood pressure increases in the upper extremities and the head. Increased cerebral blood flow means an increased risk of berry aneurysms, which happen when weak spots along blood vessels in the brain balloon out from the high pressures and become tiny sacs filled with blood. This increased pressure also tends to cause the aorta and aortic valve to dilate, or get larger, and the increased pressure means the aorta is at risk of aortic dissection, or tearing of the inner layer of the aorta.   Now, let’s look at downstream issues. Because blood flow downstream from the constriction is decreased, there’ll be decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and patients will have a weak pulse in those lower extremities. Since blood pressure’s lower, patients sometimes experience claudication in their legs, which is pain and cramping due to reduced perfusion. Also, when less blood perfuses the kidneys, the kidneys respond by activating the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, which results in water retention and ultimately increases blood pressure, causing hypertension.   Coming off the aorta, you have these smaller arteries called intercostal arteries that run alongside the ribs and supply blood to the area between the ribs, the intercostal space. Keeping aortic coarctation in mind, some of these branch off above the constriction, and they’re called anterior intercostal arteries; they branch from the internal thoracic artery, which is off the subclavian. Some of these branch off below the constriction; these are the posterior intercostal arteries that come directly from the thoracic aorta, and they supply ribs three and below. It turns out that the posterior intercostal arteries serving ribs 1 and 2 actually come off above the constriction as well. Okay, so upstream, you have increased pressure in the aorta, which causes increased pressure in the subclavian, internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal arteries, and the first two posterior intercostal arteries, and then you have decreased pressure in the posterior intercostal arteries for ribs three and below. Now, what you need to know is that these arteries are normally linked up to form an anastomosis, which means that there is a direct connection between these anterior and posterior arteries. Under normal circumstances, pressure is equal in the anterior and posterior arteries so that blood flows away from the heart, as expected.   But now that we have high pressures in these anterior arteries, and low pressures in the posterior arteries for three and below, you actually get reversed flow in the posterior intercostals.   These posterior intercostal arteries dilate to accommodate the high pressure, and when the heart beats, they pulsate and literally rub up against the ribs, slowly wearing away bone. This can be seen on x-ray as “rib notching,” which typically only affects ribs 3-9, but particularly affects ribs 3 and 4. Also, because there is high pressure in both the anterior and posterior intercostal arteries for ribs 1 and 2, there is no reversal of blood flow, so you don’t typically see rib notching there.  All right, so there are a couple of treatment options for adult aortic coarctation, which include:  balloon dilation, where a tiny balloon is used to widen the aorta; and having the narrowed area of the aorta surgically removed, which can correct the hypertension.  ###SUMMARYAll right, so, as a quick recap… Aortic coarctation is narrowing of the aorta, resulting in high blood pressure upstream and low pressure downstream. In infant aortic coarctation, the ductus arteriosus remains open after birth and deoxygenated blood goes to the lower extremities causing lower extremity cyanosis. In adults, the coarctation causes issues like a higher risk of berry aneuryms, weak pulse in the lower extremities, hypertension, and rib notching.'],\n",
              "  26: ['With thrombophlebitis, thrombo-, or thrombus, refers to a blood clot,  phleb- refers to a vein, and -itis refers to inflammation. So, thrombophlebitis is a blood clot that gets lodged in a vein and causes inflammation.Normally, the process starts with damage to the endothelium, or the inner lining of a blood vessel’s walls. After this, there’s an immediate vasoconstriction, or narrowing of the blood vessel, which limits blood flow. After that, some platelets adhere to the damaged vessel wall and become activated by collagen and tissue factor, which are proteins that are normally kept separated from the blood by an intact endothelium. These platelets then recruit additional platelets to form a plug. The formation of the platelet plug is called primary hemostasis. Next, the coagulation cascade is activated. In the blood, there’s a set of clotting factors, most of which are proteins synthesized by the liver; usually, these are inactive and just floating around in the blood. The coagulation cascade starts when one of these proteins is proteolytically cleaved. This active protein then proteolytically cleaves and activates the next clotting factor, and so on. The final step in the coagulation cascade is the activation of the protein fibrinogen to fibrin, which then deposits and polymerizes to form a mesh around the platelets. All of these steps leading up to fibrin reinforcement of the platelet plug make up the process called secondary hemostasis, and they result in a hard clot at the site of the injury. This cascade has a huge degree of amplification and takes only a few minutes to progress from injury to clot formation. The activation of the cascade is carefully controlled by anticoagulation proteins that target and inactivate key clotting factors. For example, antithrombin inactivates Factors IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa, VIIa and thrombin, while protein C inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa.As the clot grows in size, it limits the amount of blood able to pass through the vein, and pressure in the vein increases. Usually, the clot might start naturally breaking down. For example, enzymes like plasmin break down fibrin into fragments called D-dimers. There are three main factors that lead to thrombosis, and these are referred to as Virchow’s triad. The first factor is slowed blood flow, called stasis, in the veins. Typically, blood continuously flows smoothly through the blood vessel, but if the blood flow becomes turbulent, the linear flow is disrupted and slow or static pockets of blood are formed. Stasis can also happen during long periods of inactivity of the skeletal muscle pump, like bed rest or long flights and car rides. Stasis can even happen during pregnancy, when a growing baby compresses nearby veins. During stasis, platelets and other clotting factors contact the endothelium, and prolonged interaction leads to clotting factor adhesion, and, ultimately, activation of the clotting cascade. The second factor is a state of hypercoagulation, where altered amounts of clotting factors increase either primary or secondary hemostasis. This can happen for genetic reasons or acquired ones, like surgery or taking certain medications, including birth control pills. During surgery, physical damage to vessels activates the clotting cascade. Birth control pills can tip the balance towards clotting because they increase levels of clotting factors and decrease the levels of some anti-coagulation factors, like protein C and antithrombin. The third factor in Virchow’s triad is damage to the endothelial cell lining of a blood vessel that exposes tissue factor and collagen. Damage can be caused by infections, chronic inflammation, or toxins, like those found in tobacco cigarettes. 010.png Thrombophlebitis most often occurs in superficial leg veins, where it’s called superficial thrombophlebitis, and deep leg veins, where it’s called deep venous thrombosis, or DVT. That being said, it can also develop in other areas of the body, like at the site of an IV insertion, especially if an IV has been sitting in the vein for days to weeks. Other conditions that can increase the risk of thrombophlebitis are Trousseau syndrome, where some people with pancreatic cancer get thrombophlebitis in various veins, as well as Mondor disease, where thrombophlebitis occurs in the breast or front chest wall. Sometimes, thrombophlebitis can become infected; an infection in the skin or soft tissue could also cause thrombophlebitis. A classic cause of thrombophlebitis is Staphylococcus aureus, and when the blood clot is infected, it’s called septic thrombophlebitis. As you might guess, having an infected blood clot can be quite dangerous because this can lead to sepsis, and it can quickly allow that infection to be carried by the blood to other parts of the circulatory system.Thrombophlebitis is most common in limbs, and it usually occurs in the lower leg. It can make the area around the clot inflamed, and this causes pain, swelling, redness, and warmth. Superficial thrombophlebitis can cause the affected vein to become hard, like an electrical cord. Septic thrombophlebitis can also cause systemic symptoms, like fevers. If the septic thrombophlebitis is severe enough, it can lead to shock, where there’s a drop in blood pressure and organs can fail from not getting enough blood.Thrombophlebitis can be diagnosed by ultrasound. Alternatively, if the ultrasound is inconclusive, a more invasive venography procedure can be performed. This is when a dye is injected into the veins and an X-ray is taken to identify blockages. Also, a D-dimer blood test can be helpful, because fibrin break-down product levels are usually higher in the presence of a clot.Generally speaking, the body makes and breaks blood clots all the time, and some small clots resolve on their own over time. However, large clots that cause symptoms typically need an intervention. Thrombolytic enzymes can be given to help break down the clot, or a thrombectomy can be done to surgically remove the clot. Long-term treatment to prevent future thrombi from forming can include anticoagulant medications like warfarin or heparin, which inhibit the clotting cascade and prevent clot formation. Prevention of a deep vein thrombosis is also important. Compression stockings and frequent calf exercises during long periods of sitting still can help move blood through the veins to prevent stasis. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: thrombophlebitis is the inflammation of a vein around a blood clot that can be infected, in which case it’s called septic thrombophlebitis. Virchow’s Triad refers to the three main causes of thrombophlebitis: stasis, hypercoagulation of clotting factors, and damage to the endothelial lining. It most often develops in the legs and can be categorized as either superficial thrombophlebitis or deep venous thrombosis, though it can also occur in other areas of the body, especially at the site of an IV insertion.'],\n",
              "  27: ['“Deep vein” refers to the veins that typically run between muscles as they travel back towards the heart, as opposed to superficial veins that you can see on the surface, and “thrombosis” refers to a blood clot. So a deep vein thrombosis or DVT is a blood clot in one of those deep veins.  Normally, blood makes it back to the heart from the tissues and organs via a network of veins that merge over and over. Superficial veins drain blood into deep veins, which rely on the skeletal muscle pump to move blood forward. The way it works is that the surrounding skeletal muscles compress the vein and propel blood forward, and the veins prevent blood from moving backwards by using one-way valves. Ultimately, all of the blood ends up in the superior or inferior vena cava and then dumps into the right atrium. From there, the blood goes into the right ventricle and before being pumped into the pulmonary artery and eventually into the lungs. Deep vein thrombosis most commonly develops in the lower legs, below the knee, although blood clots can form in both superficial and deep veins and in other parts of the body as well. Normally, the process starts with damage to the endothelium or inner lining of blood vessel walls, after which there’s an immediate vasoconstriction or narrowing of the blood vessel, limiting the amount of blood flow. After that, some platelets adhere to the damaged vessel wall, and become activated by collagen and tissue factor, proteins that are normally kept separate from the blood by the intact endothelium. These platelets then recruit additional platelets, forming a plug. The formation of the platelet plug is called primary hemostasis. After that, the coagulation cascade is activated. First off in the blood there’s a set of clotting factors, most of which are proteins synthesized by the liver; usually these are inactive and just float around in the blood. The coagulation cascade starts when one of these proteins gets proteolytically cleaved. This active protein begins a chain reaction, proteolytically cleaving and activates the next clotting factor, and so on. The final step is activation of the protein fibrinogen to fibrin, which deposits and polymerizes to form a mesh around the platelets. These steps leading up to fibrin reinforcement of the platelet plug make up the process called secondary hemostasis; this results in a hard clot at the site of the injury. The cascade has a huge degree of amplification, taking only a few minutes from injury to clot formation. The activation of the cascade is carefully controlled by anticoagulation proteins that target and inactivate key clotting factors. For example, antithrombin inactivates Factors IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa, VIIa and thrombin, while protein S inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa. As the clot grows in size, it limits the amount of blood able to pass through, increasing the pressure in that vein. In most cases, the clot starts naturally breaking down: for example, enzymes like plasmin break down fibrin into fragments called D-dimers. Sometimes, increased pressure in the vein can cause a part of the main clot to break free. This floating clot is called an embolism which can travel downstream towards the heart. When that happens, a thromboembolism—a blood clot on the move—can move from the spot of clot formation and get into the right atrium, then into the right ventricle, before being pumped into the lungs where it can get lodged somewhere, causing a pulmonary embolism. This is a life-threatening situation because it literally blocks blood from getting into the lungs to pick up oxygen. Now, sometimes, individuals might have an atrial septal defect, a small opening between the right and left atrium. In these individuals, it’s possible for a blood clot to go from the right atrium to the left atrium, bypassing the lungs completely. Unfortunately, the clot going into the left ventricle and can sometimes get pumped out to the body, often heading towards the brain and cutting off a blood vessel serving the brain, causing an embolic stroke. There are three main factors that lead to a deep vein thrombosis, which are collectively referred to as Virchow’s triad. The first factor is slowed blood flow, called stasis, in the veins. Typically, blood flows in a continuous, smooth stream through the blood vessels. If the blood flow becomes turbulent, the linear flow is disrupted and slow or static pockets of blood are formed. Stasis can also occur during long periods of inactivity of the skeletal muscle pump, such as with bed rest, long flights and car rides, or even during pregnancy when a growing baby compresses nearby veins. During stasis, platelets and other clotting factors make contact with the endothelium, and their prolonged interaction leads to clotting factor adhesion, and, ultimately, activation of the clotting cascade. The second factor is a state of hypercoagulation, where altered amounts of clotting factors increase primary or secondary hemostasis. This can occur for genetic reasons, acquired reasons like surgery, or simply for taking certain medications like birth control pills. During surgery, physical damage to vessels activates the clotting cascade. Birth control pills tip the blood’s balance towards clotting because they increase the levels of clotting factors and decrease the levels of some anticoagulation factors like protein S and antithrombin. A third factor is damage to the endothelial cell lining of a blood vessel that exposes tissue factor and collagen. Damage can be caused by infections, chronic inflammation or toxins like those found in tobacco cigarettes. A deep vein thrombosis is most common in a limb—usually the lower leg, below the knee—and it can make the area around the clot inflamed, causing pain, swelling, redness, and warmth. If a pulmonary embolism occurs, it can cause sudden shortness of breath and chest pain, and depending on the amount of lung tissue affected, it can even be fatal.Diagnosis of a deep vein thrombosis can be made by ultrasound. Alternatively, if the ultrasound is inconclusive, a more invasive venography procedure can be performed. This is when a dye is injected into the veins and an X-ray is taken to identify blockages. Also, a D-dimer blood test can be helpful, because fibrin breakdown product levels are usually higher in the presence of a clot.Generally speaking, the body makes and breaks blood clots all the time, and some small clots resolve on their own over time, but large clots that cause symptoms typically require some sort of intervention. Thrombolytic enzymes can be given to help break down the clot, or a thrombectomy can be performed to surgically remove the clot. Long-term treatment to prevent future thrombi from forming can include the use of anticoagulant medications like warfarin or heparin, which inhibit the clotting cascade and prevent clot formation. Also, a filter can be surgically placed in the inferior vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolisms.Prevention of a deep vein thrombosis is also important. Compression stockings and frequent calf exercises during long periods of immobilization can help move blood through the veins to prevent stasis. ###SUMMARYSo, a quick recap: a deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot found in the deep tissue, particularly in the lower leg. The three main causes—stasis, hypercoagulation of clotting factors, and damage of the endothelial lining—are often referred to as Virchow’s Triad. A deep vein thrombosis can also send off a thromboembolism to the lungs which can cause a potentially fatal sudden pulmonary embolism.   '],\n",
              "  28: ['Lymph is the fluid circulating in the lymphatic system, and edema refers to fluid buildup in the body’s tissues; therefore, lymphedema is a buildup of lymph somewhere in the body’s tissues.Typically, this happens as a result of some obstruction in the lymphatic system.All right, let’s back up and briefly talk about this lymph stuff. Oxygenated blood gets sent from the heart to your tissues via arteries, which get smaller and smaller until they feed the capillary beds. The capillary beds then provide nutrients to your cells and pick up waste. Now, deoxygenated blood then feeds back into larger and larger veins, and goes back to the heart. Pressure on the arterial side is a lot higher than on the venous side, so as blood comes into the capillary bed from the smaller arteries, called arterioles, the plasma — the colorless, fluid part of blood — is literally forced out into the interstitial space, or the space between cells. The majority of that fluid is reabsorbed on the venous side, but typically there’s more forced into the tissue through the arterial side than is taken out by the venous side.  Here’s where the lymphatic system comes into play. All of that excess fluid gets pulled into the afferent lymphatic capillaries, which are closed-ended vessels found throughout the body, including, scientists discovered in 2015,  in the brain. These lymphatic capillaries have larger openings than the venous capillaries, which means that in addition to the interstitial fluid, they can accept larger proteins, cellular debris, and even bacteria, which get squeezed out of the arterial side, but are too large to get back into the venous capillaries. Once all of that stuff is in the lymphatic system, it’s called lymph. Also, those afferent lymphatic vessels have one-way valves that, along with smooth muscle contraction, keep the lymph moving along toward the lymph nodes, which have immune cells that once again help filter the fluid, getting rid of potential microbial threats. The fluid then leaves the lymph nodes and drains back into the systemic veins via the thoracic duct, or left thoracic duct, which empties into the left subclavian and jugular veins, and right thoracic duct, which empties into the right subclavian and internal jugular veins, to rejoin the blood once again.  So, let’s get back to lymphedema. When something blocks the normal flow in the lymphatic system, the lymph gets backed up, which means the interstitial fluid can’t drain properly, causing fluid to accumulate in the interstitial space. This means that those proteins and cellular debris build up too, right? When all that stuff stagnates, it initiates an inflammatory reaction that causes macrophages to release inflammatory molecules, which ultimately damage surrounding cells. This leads to fibrosis, which is the thickening of connective tissue, or the creation of scar tissue. Fibrosis causes hardening of the affected area, which is commonly in the limbs.  One of the most common global causes of lymphedema is filariasis, an infection with nematode parasites, which are tiny worms; the most common species are: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Filariasis happens when one of these nematodes gets in the lymphatic system and causes a bit of fibrosis, which creates a physical blockage that obstructs the normal flow of lymph. In developed nations, lymphedema is most commonly caused by cancer malignancy and/or its treatment.   Cancer-associated causes causes of lymphedema include: the lymphatic system itself develops a cancer that causes an obstruction, which is called a primary lymphoma; it could be a result of metastatic tumor cells from somewhere else that travel to the lymphatic system and cause an obstruction; or, it could be the result of cancer treatment, such as if an affected lymph node or group of nodes are removed via surgery. The most common cancer-associated cause of lymphedema is removal of the lymph nodes as a treatment for breast cancer. You’ll notice that all of these causes of lymphedema are the result of some other disease, so these are situations that represent secondary lymphedema.  Primary lymphedema, on the other hand, is when there isn’t some other disease or factor that leads to lymphatic obstruction. Usually, primary lymphedema is a congenital condition that’s been present since birth, possibly as a result of part of the lymphatic system not developing correctly. For this reason, most people develop lymphedema praecox, which is primary lymphedema developed before age 35. When someone develops primary lymphedema later on in life, usually after age 35, it’s called lymphedema tarda. Primary lymphedema is sometimes associated with other genetic disorders as well, such as Turner syndrome.  Early diagnosis of lymphedema is difficult because there aren’t many obvious signs, and it can sometimes mimic chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, which is when blood collects in the veins. However, usually CVI happens bilaterally, meaning on both sides of the body, as opposed to one side, as with lymphedema. Therefore, sometimes lymphedema can be diagnosed by comparing the affected limb to the unaffected limb.   To help with diagnosis, staging systems are often used; the most commonly used system is defined by the World Health Organization. During stage zero, the latent stage, there’s some damage to the lymphatics, but enough lymph is still being removed; thus, lymphedema is not present. During stage one, the spontaneously reversible phase, the tissue is in the pitting stage, where tissue indents when pressed and reverses when it’s elevated; usually, the affected area is normal or almost normal size in the morning.   In stage two, the spontaneously irreversible stage, the tissue takes on a spongy consistency, and is non-pitting; instead, it bounces back when pressed. Also, during stage two fibrosis starts to develop, and the limbs harden and increase in size. Finally, during stage three, lymphostatic elephantiasis, swelling becomes irreversible, and the affected limbs are really large and hardened from fibrosis.  Treatment depends on how severe the edema is, and how far along the fibrosis is in the affected limb. People might wear compressive bandages that can help keep fluid from accumulating, and compression lymphatic massages can help with lymph flow. If these options don’t work, sometimes people with lymphedema can have surgery to help either improve drainage or reduce fluid load. ###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap… Lymphedema is a buildup of lymph in the interstitial space as a result of an obstruction in the lymphatic system, which can cause edema, inflammation, and fibrosis in the tissues. Lymphedema can be primary, when it occurs alone, or secondary, when it occurs as a result of another disease like filariasis or cancer. Treatment includes compressive bandages, compression lymphatic massages, and surgery to help either improve drainage or reduce fluid load. '],\n",
              "  29: ['So, when we talk about ischemia, we’re usually talking about this lack of blood flow to a specific area of tissue. For example, with a heart attack, a coronary artery in the heart that supplies the left ventricle with blood gets blocked, so that localized area of heart tissue doesn’t get enough blood and oxygen; that damage is localized to that left ventricle. Shock is like ischemia, but on a global scale. In other words, it’s a circulatory failure of the whole body; blood flow to tissues is dangerously low, which leads to cellular injury, possibly damages multiple organs, and can even lead to multiple organ failure if not treated immediately. Okay, so with shock, the body’s tissues aren’t getting enough oxygen via the blood, right? Normally, blood perfuses through tissue and delivers oxygen because there’s enough pressure in the circulatory system to push it through; so, blood pressure majorly affects the amount of blood perfusing through tissues. Now, blood pressure is determined by two components: the resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels, which is affected by things like vessel length, blood viscosity, and vessel diameter; and the cardiac output, which is the volume of blood pumped by the heart through the body per minute. You can break that down into heart rate, or the number of beats per minute, multiplied by stroke volume, or the amount pumped out each beat. The stroke volume is found by taking the total volume of blood left over after contraction, which is called the end-systolic volume, and subtracting it from the total volume in the heart after filling, or the end-diastolic volume.All right, keeping all this in mind, shock can be caused by many different things, but we can categorize the different types of shock into the three main categories with some subcategories. The first category is called hypovolemic shock. Hypo means “low,” vol refers to “volume,” and emia refers to the blood; thus, hypovolemic shock is shock induced by a low fluid volume of blood. This could be either non-hemorrhagic or haemorrhagic. Non-hemorrhagic means that the loss of fluid volume isn’t from bleeding. For example, if you were stranded in a desert and suffered severe dehydration, eventually your loss of fluid from sweating would reduce blood volume to the point that it wouldn’t be enough to supply your body’s organs, and you’d develop hypovolemic shock. Hecommorrhagic hypovolemic shock, on the other hand, is loss of blood volume through ruptured blood vessels; in other words, it’s loss of blood volume from bleeding. A loss of about 20% of your total blood volume, which is roughly one liter, can be enough to induce hypovolemic shock. When that liter of blood leaves circulation, the total volume filling into the heart goes down; this means that the end-diastolic volume goes down, which causes stroke volume to go down as well. Therefore, cardiac output goes down, and finally we see blood pressure go down. When cardiac output goes down, catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, ADH, and angiotensin II are released. These all cause vasoconstriction of blood vessels, which increases vascular resistance and heart rate, and in turn, this increases cardiac output. These combined effects increase blood pressure. A super important indicator that tissues  are not getting enough oxygen due to hypovolemia is a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation, or MVO2. MVO2 is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the blood coming to the right side of the heart from the tissues. It’s like the amount of oxygen left over, or not extracted and used by the tissues. So, if blood volume is down, it means that oxygen is down, and there’s going to be less left over, right? So MVO2 will be down with hypovolemic shock. Because blood flow also provides heat to the tissues, when it’s down, the skin starts to feel cool and clammy; thus, hypovolemic shock is considered a cold shock. A second main category of shock is cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic means produced by the heart, right? So, this is when something happens to the heart that prevents it from pumping enough blood to the body’s tissues. The most common cause is acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Hold on a second! Didn’t we say at the beginning that a heart attack was more like localized ischemia? Well, the heart attack itself reflects ischemia, but the effects of the initial cardiac damage eventually lead to a state of shock. When the heart’s muscle cells die, it can’t contract as hard, which means the amount of blood pumped out, or stroke volume, goes down; therefore, cardiac output goes down as well. In the same way as with hypovolemic shock, the body releases vasoconstrictors to increase vascular resistance and help maintain blood pressure. Also, similar to hypovolemic shock, in cardiogenic shock MVO2 will be down because since there’s less oxygen being pumped out, less will be left over. Sometimes, there might be an obstruction that doesn’t allow the heart to fill properly with blood. For example, we might have the pericardial sac fill up with fluid from an infection or with blood from trauma, like getting stabbed in the chest. If this sac fills up, it physically constricts and prevents the heart from expanding and contracting normally, reducing the stroke volume. This is sometimes “sub” classified as obstructive shock, but you can see that the cause is still due to the heart’s inability to do its job, right? As in hypovolemic shock, a reduction in cardiac output leads to lowered blood flow, so the skin gets cool and clammy; therefore, cardiogenic shock is also considered a kind of cold shock.   All right, the third main category of shock is called distributive shock. In this category, there’s typically “leakiness” of blood vessels and an excessive amount of arteriole vasodilation, or widening of the peripheral blood vessels. Remember, this widening is one of the components of vascular resistance? If arterioles dilate, vascular resistance to blood flow goes down, and so blood pressure goes down, which leads to less perfusion and distribution of blood to organs and tissues. Now, the most common type of distributive shock is septic shock, which is from pathogens in the blood, and most commonly, gram-negative pathogens. Here’s what happens with septic shock: endotoxins, these large clunky lipopolysaccharide molecules, or LPS, found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria cause a crazy cascade of events that ultimately lead to lowered perfusion. First, these guys directly damage endothelial cells and cause them to release vasodilators, such as nitric oxide. They also activate the complement pathway in the blood, which stimulates mass cell release of histamine, another vasodilator. The LPS molecules also activate immune cells, like macrophages and neutrophils, which help create a bunch of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1. These help the immune system destroy the invaders, but they also stimulate the endothelial cells to release more inflammatory molecules, like platelet activating factor and reactive oxygen species. All of these inflammatory chemicals damage the endothelial cells and increases their vascular permeability, making the blood vessels “leaky.” Endothelial cells also express a procoagulant called tissue factor. Procoagulants are molecules that increase blood coagulation, or blood clotting. These procoagulants combine with an overall decrease in anti-coagulants, which decrease clotting and seem to be often depleted or used up during sepsis, to create a net increase in coagulation and clotting in the microvasculature. Of course, clotting and blockages in the blood vessels further decreases perfusion, right? Okay, so this widespread vasodilation means very little vascular resistance. Blood can’t get the chance to unload as much oxygen as it cruises through the vasculature, and it gets back to the right side of the heart with leftover oxygen. Thus, in this case, in contrast to cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock, MVO2 can be normal or even increased. Also contrary to hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, there’s an increase in flow in the peripheral blood vessels, so the skin becomes warm and flushed; therefore, distributive shock is a kind of warm shock.The combined effects of widespread vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and microvascular blood clotting contribute to decreased perfusion of blood to vital organs. Now, two subcategories of distributive shock are: anaphylactic shock, which is an allergic reaction that causes dangerously low blood pressure; and neurogenic shock, which is when the nervous system gets damaged and can’t control the body’s blood pressure. The treatment of shock depends on the cause. In general, the goal is to stabilize blood pressure so that vital organs like the heart and the brain are perfused with blood. In order to stabilize blood pressure, fluid replacement and medications that increase heart contractility, cause vasoconstriction, and retain fluid can be administered. Oftentimes a person might need supplemental oxygen or have their airway protected, for example with intubation.###SUMMARYAlright, as a quick recap. Shock is ultimately a failure in tissue perfusion, and it affects the whole body, putting tissues and organs at risk for injury and ultimately organ failure. Hypovolemic shock happens when dehydration or hemorrhage reduce the volume of blood in the blood vessels. Cardiogenic shock happens when a direct injury like a heart attack or an obstruction like a pericardial effusion prevents the heart from pumping blood efficiently. Distributive shock happens when something like an allergic reaction or damage to the nervous system - called neurogenic shock causes the blood vessels to vasodilate and become leaky which reduces the resistance and lowers the blood pressure.

              "  30: ['In angiosarcoma, -sarcoma refers to a malignant tumor, and angio- refers to a blood vessel or a lymphatic vessel. So angiosarcoma is a cancer of either a blood vessel, in which case it’s called a hemangiosarcoma, or a cancer of a lymphatic vessel, in which case it’s called a lymphangiosarcoma. Both arise from the inner lining of the vessel wall, known as endothelium. Angiosarcomas form when endothelial cells suddenly start proliferating abnormally. If these masses grow inside the blood vessel lumen, they can obstruct the blood flow, and that interferes with the oxygen and nutrient supply to various tissues, and can eventually result in tissue ischemia. If lymph flow is obstructed, lymph fluid backs up in the tissues, causing lymphedema. Cancer cells from hemangiosarcomas and lymphangiosarcomas can also invade the vessel wall, destroying it and making it burst, leading to bleeding or lymph fluid outflow in the surrounding tissue. In general, these cancer cells multiply rapidly and can be easily carried by blood flow or lymphatic flow to far-off sites within the body, particularly the lungs, where they form a new, metastatic tumor or tumors. Because of this, angiosarcoma is considered to be a particularly aggressive type of cancer. Angiosarcomas can occur anywhere in the body, but most often develop within the skin, bone, soft tissue, breast, or liver, and often spread from those locations to the lungs. Angiosarcoma of the skin usually shows up on the head or neck as a raised, purplish skin area that looks like a bruise that doesn’t heal; it may bleed, be painful, or be accompanied by swelling of the skin surrounding the affected area. Angiosarcoma of the bone is usually multifocal, meaning it affects multiple sites within the same bone, or involves multiple bones of the same limb. The exact causes of angiosarcoma remain unknown. One risk factor is chronic lymphedema in some part of the body, like the arms or legs, that goes on for several years. This  typically occurs when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged, and the fluid in the tissues has no way of draining away. Lymph nodes are sometimes surgically removed as part of cancer treatment, or destroyed by trauma infection, or they might not even have been present any point due to a congenital problem. Angiosarcomas in the liver have been associated with vinyl chloride gas, a by-product of PVC manufacturing that’s also found in arsenic insecticide.Symptoms of angiosarcoma depend on the affected organ. Soft tissue angiosarcomas can cause pain and swelling, and can compress peripheral nerves which causes sensations of tingling, pricking or numbness. In the breast, angiosarcomas form rapidly-growing, palpable masses, while in the liver, hepatic angiosarcomas can cause vague symptoms like fatigue and abdominal pain. Metastasis of angiosarcoma to the lungs can cause chest pain and lead to difficulty breathing. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma is based on a biopsy of the mass. Imaging studies like an MRI or CT can help establish the location and extension of the cancer. Treatment of angiosarcoma depends on the location and extent of the tumor, and can include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, or a combination of these three.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, angiosarcoma is an aggressive cancer of the endothelial cells lining the walls of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. It usually affects the skin on the head and neck, soft tissue, bones, breast or liver, but also metastasizes quickly and can spread to other areas of the body, particularly the lungs.'],\n",
              "  31: [\"The truncus arteriosus is a big structure that’s present during fetal development; later in development, it divides to form two separate arteries: the aorta and pulmonary artery. Once it’s fully developed, the aorta comes from the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery comes from the right ventricle.   A persistent truncus arteriosus describes when this developmental structure doesn’t divide into the two separate arteries. Instead, the baby’s left with one giant artery that branches off from both the right and the left ventricles that then splits off into the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Sometimes, this condition is simply referred to as truncus arteriosus, or TA. The cause of TA is unknown; however, a lot of cases seem to be associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge Syndrome.  Let’s switch to a more simplified view of the heart. All right, so usually deoxygenated blood comes in from the body and travels to the right atrium; then, it goes to the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs to be re-oxygenated. Next, freshly oxygenated blood passes from the lungs to the left atrium, goes to the left ventricle, and gets pumped through the aorta to the body. Then that circuit repeats, right?  If these two great arteries, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, don’t divide, you essentially have this massive artery coming from both ventricles. However, notice that this one big artery does eventually split into the aorta and pulmonary artery. Even though they eventually split off, before they do, it’s just one single vessel; thus, the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix. When deoxygenated blood mixes into the systemic circulation, it’ll often present as cyanosis, a bluish-purple discoloration of the skin, which can be seen in a baby within the first days after birth.Before birth though, things actually work a little differently. Deoxygenated blood gets sent to the mother, and then oxygenated blood comes from the mother; because the fetus is not using their lungs yet, the fetal heart uses a few tricks, such as sending blood through the foramen ovale. What’s important about this is that because the fetus doesn’t use their lungs yet, there’s relatively high vascular resistance, and therefore high pressure in the pulmonary circulation. So, even though there’s this huge main blood vessel mixing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, the fetus actually does pretty well because the pressures in the two circuits are relatively similar; this similarity means that both circulations get about the same amount of blood.   After the baby’s born, the mother obviously stops supplying blood, the foramen ovale typically closes, and the baby starts to rely on their own lungs. All of this leads to a decrease in vascular resistance and pressure in the pulmonary circuit, which is actually normal. This being said, now there’s a pressure differential between the left and right side, where the left side is higher than the right side, which is also normal. What’s not normal though, is that with TA, the blood’s still able to mix. So, what ends up happening is that since the pressure’s lower in the pulmonary circuit to the lungs, blood tends to shunt toward the lungs, so more blood volume goes to the lungs and less goes to the body. This extra blood volume on the right side leads to fluid overload; with all this extra volume, the heart begins to fail. Therefore, babies with TA quickly develop heart failure, potentially within weeks after birth. Due to the severity of complications with TA, newborn babies require surgical repair. The main goal is to restore normal blood flow through the heart.  ###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap… persistent truncus arteriosus is a congenital defect where the truncus arteriosus doesn't split properly into the aorta and pulmonary artery during fetal development. This allows mixing of oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood, resulting in cyanosis soon after birth and even heart failure. Treatment involves surgery to repair the defect.\"],\n",
              "  32: [\"Normally, the heart is set up so that the left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood out to the body through the aorta; deoxygenated blood comes back to the right atrium, flows into the right ventricle, and is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. From the pulmonary artery, it comes back to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and the whole process restarts. The “great arteries,” are the two main arteries taking blood away from the heart: the aorta and pulmonary artery. “Transposing” means that two things switch places with each other. So, transposition of the great arteries, or TGA, is when these two arteries swap locations.   Normally, blood flows through all of these chambers and blood vessels in a big circuit, but if you switch these two main arteries, you switch from one big circuit to two smaller circuits. On the left side, blood is now pumped from the left ventricle, to the pulmonary artery, and to the lungs; it then comes back to the left atrium and left ventricle, and restarts the circuit. On the right side, blood is pumped out of the right ventricle through the aorta, and then goes to the body; blood comes back the the right atrium and right ventricle, and restarts the circuit. Blood on the right side therefore never gets oxygenated, and blood on the left side never gets deoxygenated. This isn’t good. This situation is actually called complete TGA, or sometimes dextro-TGA or d-TGA; dextro means “right,” because, in this case, the aorta is in front of and primarily to the right of the pulmonary artery.  All right, when the fetus in still in the mother’s uterus, babies with d-TGA don’t have any symptoms because they aren’t using their lungs yet. Instead, they rely on blood from the mother and a few shunts for blood flow, including: the foramen ovale, a gap between the atria; the ductus arteriosus, a vessel connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery; and the ductus venosus, a vessel connecting the umbilical cord to the inferior vena cava.   However, after birth, when the baby has to use its lungs for oxygen, these shunts normally go away, the foramen ovale closes, and the vessels become ligaments. This essentially means that d-TGA leads to death, unless there is some way for blood between the pulmonary and systemic circulations to mix. Some possibilities of this happening are if the foramen ovale or ductus arteriosus stay open, or if the baby has a ventricular septal defect, which happens when there’s a shunt between the ventricles — this is actually present in about a third of cases. Any of these possibilities allow the two independent circuits to mix blood and deliver some oxygenated blood to the tissues.   This being said, this system still isn’t very efficient, and a significant amount of deoxygenated blood gets sent to the body’s tissues, which causes cyanosis, a bluish-purple discoloration of the mouth, lips, fingertips, and toes — all areas furthest away from the heart. Sometimes, babies might be given prostaglandin E, which keeps the ductus arteriosus open; however, this is typically only a short-term solution, and ultimately the baby’s going to need surgical repair.   If the shunt is large enough, the initial symptoms might not be noticed, and if the TGA isn’t repaired, the heart can progress to congestive heart failure. This is because the roles of the ventricles have been switched, right? In other words, the right ventricle now pumps out to the higher-pressure systemic circuit, even though it’s built for low-pressure systems, and the left ventricle pumps out to the lower pressure pulmonary circuit, even though it’s built for high pressure systems. So, in response, the right ventricle can hypertrophy, or get larger, and the left ventricle might atrophy, or get smaller; these massive changes in heart structure can ultimately cause the heart to fail.  Less commonly, babies can have levo-transposition of the great arteries, or l-TGA. Levo means that the aorta is primarily to the “left” of the pulmonary artery. In this form, the great arteries are still connected to the wrong ventricle, but the ventricles also switch places along with their atrioventricular valves. In this case, unlike d-TGA, circulation is preserved; therefore, sometimes this is called congenitally corrected TGA. This type is acyanotic, or “not-blue.” For this reason, babies with l-TGA usually won’t have any obvious symptoms at birth. Now, if you take a step back and look at this heart, it doesn’t look that different from a normal heart. However, remember that the left ventricle and mitral valve are built to withstand higher pressures, and the right ventricle and tricuspid valve are built for lower pressures. So, if these guys switch roles and now the right ventricle and tricuspid valve see higher pressures than they’re used to, after years pumping against higher pressures, the right ventricle can hypertrophy, grow in size, and stretch out the tricuspid valve; thus, adults with this issue are at greater risk of heart failure.  Ultimately, the cause of TGA is unknown, but there are diseases and behaviors that are associated with greater risk of babies having TGA. Some known risk factors are related to the pregnancy, such as the expecting mother having diabetes or rubella, poor nutrition, alcohol consumption, and being over 40 years old.  Transposition of the great arteries is diagnosed with an echocardiogram.  Infants that exhibit cyanosis after birth are routinely checked for TGA or other heart abnormalities, but those without symptoms might not be diagnosed until they show symptoms of heart failure later in life.###SUMMARYAll right, so, as a quick recap… transposition of the great arteries, or TGA, is a congenital defect where the aorta and pulmonary artery switch places so they're connected to the wrong ventricle. TGAs can either be dextro or levo-TGA. In d-TGA, only the arteries have switched places, so there’s no oxygenation of blood, leading to cyanosis and death soon after birth. In l-TGA, the great arteries and the ventricles swap places, so the blood is able to get oxygenated, and there’s no cyanosis at birth. l-TGA can lead to heart failure in adults.  TGA is diagnosed with an echocardiogram and is treated surgically.  \"],\n",
              "  33: ['If you’ve ever played Tetris, you probably know that you use pieces made of groups of four squares. Tetralogy of Fallot, or TOF, is a congenital heart condition where patients have four heart abnormalities. Here’s a look at the normal heart: the upper chambers, or the left and the right atria; the lower chambers, or the left and the right ventricles; the aorta; and the pulmonary artery. Instead of using this anatomical heart, let’s look at a simplified version.Let’s go through four abnormal findings of TOF, one at a time. The first abnormality is stenosis, or narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract into the pulmonary artery. This could either be narrowing of the valve itself, or narrowing of the infundibulum, which is the area right below the valve. Either way, this makes it harder for deoxygenated blood to get to the pulmonary circulation. In response, the myocardium of the right ventricle hypertrophies, or gets thicker, in order to contract harder and push blood past the stenosis. This is the second feature of TOF.  This causes their heart to look “boot-shaped” on an x-ray. The third feature is that patients have a large ventricular septal defect, which is a gap between the ventricles that allows blood to shunt between them. Now, in a patient with an isolated ventricular septal defect, which is when the patient doesn’t have TOF, oxygenated blood is shunted from the left side to the right side because the pressure on the left is higher than the pressure on the right. For patients with TOF, however, the right ventricular outflow obstruction might block the normal blood flow so much that the pressure in the right ventricle has to be really high to get past it. Well, the high right-sided pressure causes the left side of the heart to become the path of least resistance, and deoxygenated blood shunts from the right side to the left side. The fourth and final feature of TOF is that the aorta overrides the ventricular septal defect. This one is variable; sometimes, the aorta is way over here sitting on top of the septal defect, and sometimes it’s more on the left ventricular side. Either way, if deoxygenated blood is shunted from right to left, it flows over to the left ventricle and immediately out to the body. When you think about it, the critical feature of these four abnormalities is the degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction. With less obstruction, oxygenated blood might be shunted from left to right and get into the pulmonary circulation, where it takes another run through the lungs. With more obstruction, deoxygenated blood is shunted from right to left and enters the systemic circulation; more deoxygenated blood going to the body essentially means less oxygenation of the tissues, right?In fact, shunting can be severe enough to let the oxygen saturation fall below 80%, at which point patients’ skin takes on a bluish or purpish discoloration, called cyanosis. Tetralogy of Fallot is actually the most common cause of cyanotic congenital heart defects, accounting for about 50-70% of them, and for about 10% of all congenital heart defects in general. Now, it’s not quite clear why some babies develop TOF, but it is associated with chromosome 22 deletions and DiGeorge syndrome. Babies with TOF often have cyanosis around their lips and fingernail beds at birth, and can have clubbing of their fingers and toes within a few months. On the other hand, if a baby doesn’t have severe right ventricular outflow obstruction, they might not be cyanotic. Nevertheless, having any decrease in the normal oxygenation of blood can affect the baby in a lot of ways; those born with TOF can have a range of symptoms, including feeding difficulty and failure to gain weight and develop normally.Babies with TOF often experience symptoms and cyanosis in spells that are referred to as “tet spells.” For example, imagine the baby’s cruising around, increasing oxygen demand; their heart will try to pump more blood, leading to a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation, which causes them to be cyanotic. When this happens, they’ll squat down to reduce the cyanosis. Why does this help? Well, squatting down or getting into a knees to chest position slightly kinks the femoral arteries in the legs, which increases vascular resistance in the peripheral arteries; this increases pressure in the systemic circulation, which increases pressure in the left ventricle enough that the pressure in the left side is now greater than the right side. That shunt temporarily reverses, forcing blood to take the path to the lungs to be oxygenated, thus reducing cyanosis. When patients do have a serious hypercyanotic episode or “tet spell,” they can be treated by keeping them calm and giving them oxygen and IV fluids, and providing them with medications that are aimed at improving pulmonary blood flow.  A diagnosis of TOF is usually made with echocardiography, which can even be done prenatally. Most patients with Tetralogy of Fallot will have cardiac repair surgery in the first year of life; in this procedure, the ventricular septal defect is closed with a patch, and the right ventricular outflow tract is enlarged. Fixing these two defects resolves problems caused by the other two defects. When the right ventricle no longer has to work so hard to pump blood to the lungs, it can return to a normal thickness. Fixing the ventricular septal defect means that only oxygen-rich blood will flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta.### SUMMARYAll right, so, as a quick recap… Tetralogy of Fallot, or TOF, is a congenital disorder characterized by four heart abnormalities—stenosis in the right ventricular outflow tract, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and aortic override of septal defect. Together, these can cause cyanosis in the newborn and is diagnosed with echocardiography. TOF can be corrected using cardiac repair surgery in the first year of life.'],\n",
              "  34: ['Hypo means “beneath” or “under,” and plasia means “molding” or “formation,” so hypoplastic means “under form” or in this case, “underdeveloped.” Therefore, hypoplastic left heart syndrome means that the left side of the heart doesn’t fully develop. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, or HLHS, is a congenital heart defect that affects the left side of the heart; it specifically affects the left ventricle and ascending aorta. Also, the aortic valve and mitral valve might be either too small to allow enough blood to flow through, or they might be absent altogether, which is called atresia. The exact mechanism that causes HLHS isn’t known, but one popular theory is that there might be some other primary congenital heart defect that reduces the blood flow through the LV and outflow tract during fetal development, so that part of the heart does not grow and develop normally. This said, HLHS is also often associated with other congenital heart defects, and in particular, with an atrial septal defect, which is an opening between the left and right atria. In fact, not only do these babies usually have this defect, they essentially need it to survive after birth. This is in addition to a patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA, a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery, which usually closes within a few days after birth.   Let’s switch to a more simplified version of the heart to see what happens with blood flow. So, right here you have the atrial septal defect connecting the left and right atria, and the ductus arteriosus, which connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery. This is a really underdeveloped left ventricle and a smallish aortic and mitral valve.   All right, so now let’s take out this septal defect and PDA. What happens? Well, deoxygenated blood comes from the body and goes into the right atrium, then goes to the right ventricle, gets pumped to the lungs, and then oxygenated blood comes back to the left atrium. At this point, blood has a super hard time getting to the left ventricle, so the pressure in the left atrium is high. Blood that does manage to get into the left ventricle is very weakly pumped out to the body. This situation obviously isn’t sustainable, right?So, now let’s add in the septal defect and PDA. Oxygenated blood comes into the left atrium, and since the pressure on the left side is so high, it takes the path of least resistance, and goes through the septal defect and mixes with deoxygenated blood in the right atrium. It then goes to the right ventricle and is pumped out the pulmonary artery, where some of it travels back to the left side through the PDA to the aorta, and out to the body. Clearly, this system isn’t the most efficient way to move blood around the heart, right? But it can be enough to keep the baby alive, and sometimes even relatively asymptomatic in the hours immediately after birth. Normally, within the first day after birth, the ductus arteriosus starts clamping shut, and within three weeks it’s completely closed off and turned into the ligamentum arteriosum. As it closes, blood flow gets more and more restricted to the body, causing cyanosis, or bluish purple discoloration of the skin. Eventually, this leads to cardiogenic shock, and without intervention of some kind, HLHS is fatal. HLHS is often diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound, but occasionally isn’t diagnosed until after the baby is born using echocardiography. Prostaglandin is often given to babies to help keep the ductus arteriosus open until a staged surgery can be performed to fix the heart defects. Occasionally, a heart transplant can be done as well, but because of the complexity of HLHS, these treatment decisions are made on a patient-by-patient basis.###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap... Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, or HLHS, is a congenital heart defect where the left ventricle and ascending aorta don’t fully develop. It’s often associated with other heart defects and causes cyanosis because it limits the amount of blood pumped to the body. Without surgical intervention, HLHS is fatal.'],\n",
              "  35: ['Patent — not in the sense of a patent for an invention — refers to some opening. A patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA for short, refers to a blood vessel, the ductus arteriosus, which connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta during fetal development. The ductus arteriosus is right on the aortic arch where vessels branch off to the brain and upper extremities. All right, so to help visualize this, let’s look at a super simplified version of the heart to show the relationship between the aorta, branches, pulmonary artery, and ductus arteriosus. We’ll still keep the more anatomical heart for reference. So, the ductus arteriosus usually closes after birth because the walls collapse down; this vessel becomes a ligament, the ligamentum arteriosum. When it stays open after birth, we call it a patent ductus arteriosus because it’s still passing blood through it; in other words, it’s still patent. Now, during development, the fetus doesn’t use the lungs yet; instead, it relies on oxygenated blood from the placenta, which comes into the right atrium. Most of that blood actually flows through the foramen ovale, an opening between the atria. Blood that doesn’t make it through the foramen ovale is pumped out of the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, at which point most of it gets sent through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta instead of to the lungs. Remember, the fetus isn’t using the lungs yet.During fetal development, the ductus arteriosus is kept open by high levels of a vasodilator prostaglandin E2, which is made by the placenta and the ductus arteriosus. At birth, a bunch of things change. First, oxygen levels in the blood go up dramatically and the lungs become the main source of oxygenated blood. Soon after birth, the foramen ovale closes and prostaglandin E2 levels fall, causing the ductus arteriosus to close off. The lungs also start to release a small peptide called bradykinin, which constricts the smooth muscle wall of the ductus arteriosus and sort of helps the process along. Within the first day, the ductus arteriosus usually starts clamping shut; within three weeks, it’s completely closed off and turned into the ligamentum arteriosum. If the ductus arteriosus doesn’t close, then the baby is left with a patent ductus arteriosus. This condition accounts for about 10% of all congenital heart defects, of which the vast majority, about 90%, are isolated heart defects, meaning there aren’t any additional congenital defects. On the other hand, a PDA can be associated with other congenital problems, such as congenital rubella syndrome, which happens when the mother contracts rubella virus during her pregnancy.All right, so now we’ve got this ductus arteriosus still open, and the patient is still using their lungs; what happens now? Well, as blood comes into the right atrium, and then goes to the right ventricle, it approaches the ductus arteriosus and has two options: keep going down the pulmonary artery, or reroute to the higher pressure system in the aorta. Since blood likes to move from high pressure to low pressure, and there’s higher pressure over in the aorta, it actually just keeps going on to the lungs. Next, that freshly oxygenated blood comes over into the left atrium and the left ventricle; now, again it has a choice, but this time it’s already in the higher pressure system, and now some of it is shunted back to the lower pressure in the pulmonary artery. At this point, the shunt is left-to-right, so oxygenated blood flows back and takes a second unnecessary trip to the lungs. What we don’t have is any deoxygenated blood escaping into the systemic circulation, which would cause a baby to appear cyanotic; therefore, we call this acyanotic, which means “not blue”.Usually, this situation is asymptomatic, and patients can have what’s known as a holosystolic “machine-like” murmur from blood moving from the aorta to the pulmonary artery.However, later in life, patients might develop pulmonary hypertension from years of increased pulmonary blood volume, or higher pressures on the pulmonary side. If this happens, pressure might eventually increase to a point where right-sided pressures are greater than left-sided pressures, and thus the flow of blood through the PDA can be reversed. When this changes from a left-to-right shunt to a right-to left shunt, it’s referred to as Eisenmenger’s syndrome. Now, you’ve got deoxygenated blood flowing into the aorta and generally heading to the lower extremities, because the upper extremities and head typically have arterial branches upstream from the PDA. This results in cyanosis in the lower extremities, which is a blue or purple discoloration of the skin that’s the result of deoxygenated blood mixing with oxygenated blood. This situation is sometimes called differential cyanosis because only the lower body is cyanotic. Patent ductus arteriosus can actually be treated early on. Remember how prostaglandin E2 keeps the ductus arteriosus open during fetal development? Well, the drug indomethacin can be used to close a PDA because it’s a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, that inhibits prostaglandin E2. In some cases, the PDA may be closed by surgical ligation as well. ### SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap.... When the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, it’s called patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA. PDA allows some oxygenated blood to return back to the lungs but it doesn’t allow deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation, which means it’s acyanotic.  Initially PDA causes a left-to-right shunt, resulting in pulmonary hypertension. Over time, as the pulmonary artery pressure increases, this is converted into a right-to-left shunt. This switch in the shunt is known as Eisenmenger’s syndrome. PDA can be treated with the drug indomethacin, or by surgical ligation.'],\n",
              "  36: ['If you look at the heart, you’ve got the right and left atria up top, and the right and left ventricles down below. Each of these pairs is separated by a wall called the septum. A ventricular septal defect is when the lower wall, the ventricular septum, has a gap in it after development.   The septum is formed during development as a muscular ridge of tissue grows upward from the apex, or the tip, and then fuses with a thinner membranous region coming down from the endocardial cushions. Voila: now there are two separate chambers. However, If these tissues don’t fuse, then a gap is left between the two chambers; this is a ventricular septal defect, or VSD. The majority of cases are caused by a defect in the membranous portion of the septum.  Among babies, VSDs are actually the overall most common congenital defect. However, 30 to 50% of VSDs can spontaneously close during childhood, which makes ventricular defects less common among adults. VSDs are associated with fetal alcohol syndrome and Down syndrome, and are often associated with other cardiac deformities.   All right, so let’s check out what happens with blood flow, now that there’s this opening between the two ventricles. We’ll switch to this super-duper simplified image of the heart, just because it’s easier to show what’s going on with blood flow. So, deoxygenated blood comes from the body to the right atrium, and then flows down into the right ventricle; here, it can now either be pumped out to the lungs as normal, or pop over to the left ventricle. Because the pressure on the left side of the heart is actually higher than on the right, and because blood likes to flow from high pressure to low pressure, it actually prefers to just keep going into the lungs. When oxygenated blood comes back from the lungs and enters the left atrium, and then the left ventricle, again it’s got two choices: it can either be pumped out to the body, or flow over to the right ventricle through the gap. Since now the blood is in the left ventricle, which has higher pressure, some of the blood flows over to the lower pressure right ventricle; thus, now there’s a left-to-right shunt through which oxygenated blood takes an extra trip to the lungs.   Because there’s more oxygenated blood over here, patients will have increased oxygen saturation in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Also, the blood flowing through a VSD can be heard as a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  If it’s a small VSD, it might be asymptomatic. As the size of the VSD increases, however, symptoms tend to get more severe and present earlier in life. What sort of symptoms? Well, as blood is shunted to the right side, blood volume increases on the right side, which might lead patients to develop pulmonary hypertension, or higher pressures on the pulmonary side. If pressure increases to a point where the right side’s more than the left side, then the direction of blood flow through the VSD can switch from being left-to-right to right-to-left; this condition is known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Now, deoxygenated blood is escaping out to the systemic circulation, and being pumped out to the whole body via the aorta. This essentially means that less oxygen is being delivered to the tissues, which definitely isn’t good. Patients can present with cyanosis; specifically, it can appear as bluish skin in certain areas, such as around the lips or the fingertips.   Due to the severity of these complications associated with larger defects, surgical closure of the VSD might be needed.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… ventricular septal defect, or VSD, is a congenital disorder where the wall separating the right and left ventricle doesn’t fuse properly during fetal development, and leaves a gap. If the VSD doesn’t close spontaneously during childhood, it can result in a left-to-right shunt initially, which over time may convert into a right-to-left shunt. This switch in the is known as Eisenmenger syndrome. Treatment involves surgical closure of the defect.'],\n",
              "  37: ['Coarctation is a fancy way of saying “narrowing,” so a coarctation of the aorta means a narrowing of the aorta. If we look at the heart, we’ve got the right and left atria, the right and left ventricles, the pulmonary artery leaving the right ventricle to go to the lungs, and the aorta leaving the left ventricle to go to the body.   There are two forms of aortic coarctation to be familiar with: an “infant” form and an “adult” form. With the infant form, which accounts for about 70% of cases, the coarctation comes after the aortic arch, which branches off to the upper extremities and to the head, and before the ductus arteriosus. Now, you might be thinking, “Hey, what’s this ductus arteriosus thing doing here?” Well, typically this guy only exists during fetal development and closes after birth, but with infantile coarctation, the ductus arteriosus is usually still open, or patent, so there’s a patent ductus arteriosus. In fact, sometimes this form is also called preductal coarctation.  So, if we draw out a more simplified version of the heart, we’ve got deoxygenated blood coming into the right atrium that flows into the right ventricle. Now, as it’s pumped out of the pulmonary artery, it’s got two choices, right? One option is to go through the patent ductus arteriosus and continue down the aorta; the other option is to continue down the way it’s going. Well, since it’s higher pressure over here on the left side, you might think that the blood would say “thanks, but no thanks,” and keep going down the lower pressure pulmonary artery. Instead, this aortic coarctation adds a little twist. Since the spot right before the ductus arteriosus is narrower, blood flowing from the left side has a harder time going through, so actually there’s high pressure upstream of the coarctation, but low pressure downstream. So, what happens is that blood decides to go this way, through the patent ductus arteriosus and into the lower pressure area in the systemic circulation, and then continues down to the lower extremities, rather than the slightly higher pressure pulmonary artery. This gives you a real sense of exactly how much this coarctation reduces the pressure over on the systemic side.   Since deoxygenated blood is going to the lower extremities, infants typically present with lower extremity cyanosis, meaning a bluish or purplish discoloration of the lower limbs, which is often present even at birth. This is a really important thing to catch, because without intervention, these infants often don’t survive past the neonatal period. Infantile coarctation is something that happens during fetal development, and can occur on its own or can be associated with other congenital changes. It’s worth mentioning that it’s highly associated with Turner syndrome, a genetic abnormality where females only have one X chromosome instead of two.All right, this brings us to adult coarctation, which accounts for the other 30% of cases, and typically develops, well, as an adult. Compared to infantile coarctation, in this type there usually isn’t a patent ductus arteriosus; instead, it’s been long since closed off and is now known as the ligamentum arteriosum. The coarctation usually happens in adults just distal to this ligament. So, now there’s no mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, but just like in infantile coarctation, the pressure is increased before the coarctation, because blood has a harder time squeezing through this narrowed artery, and it’s going to be lower downstream from the coarctation.  This causes both upstream and downstream issues. Upstream issues include blood flow increases into the aortic branches, and thus blood pressure increases in the upper extremities and the head. Increased cerebral blood flow means an increased risk of berry aneurysms, which happen when weak spots along blood vessels in the brain balloon out from the high pressures and become tiny sacs filled with blood. This increased pressure also tends to cause the aorta and aortic valve to dilate, or get larger, and the increased pressure means the aorta is at risk of aortic dissection, or tearing of the inner layer of the aorta.   Now, let’s look at downstream issues. Because blood flow downstream from the constriction is decreased, there’ll be decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and patients will have a weak pulse in those lower extremities. Since blood pressure’s lower, patients sometimes experience claudication in their legs, which is pain and cramping due to reduced perfusion. Also, when less blood perfuses the kidneys, the kidneys respond by activating the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, which results in water retention and ultimately increases blood pressure, causing hypertension.   Coming off the aorta, you have these smaller arteries called intercostal arteries that run alongside the ribs and supply blood to the area between the ribs, the intercostal space. Keeping aortic coarctation in mind, some of these branch off above the constriction, and they’re called anterior intercostal arteries; they branch from the internal thoracic artery, which is off the subclavian. Some of these branch off below the constriction; these are the posterior intercostal arteries that come directly from the thoracic aorta, and they supply ribs three and below. It turns out that the posterior intercostal arteries serving ribs 1 and 2 actually come off above the constriction as well. Okay, so upstream, you have increased pressure in the aorta, which causes increased pressure in the subclavian, internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal arteries, and the first two posterior intercostal arteries, and then you have decreased pressure in the posterior intercostal arteries for ribs three and below. Now, what you need to know is that these arteries are normally linked up to form an anastomosis, which means that there is a direct connection between these anterior and posterior arteries. Under normal circumstances, pressure is equal in the anterior and posterior arteries so that blood flows away from the heart, as expected.   But now that we have high pressures in these anterior arteries, and low pressures in the posterior arteries for three and below, you actually get reversed flow in the posterior intercostals.   These posterior intercostal arteries dilate to accommodate the high pressure, and when the heart beats, they pulsate and literally rub up against the ribs, slowly wearing away bone. This can be seen on x-ray as “rib notching,” which typically only affects ribs 3-9, but particularly affects ribs 3 and 4. Also, because there is high pressure in both the anterior and posterior intercostal arteries for ribs 1 and 2, there is no reversal of blood flow, so you don’t typically see rib notching there.  All right, so there are a couple of treatment options for adult aortic coarctation, which include:  balloon dilation, where a tiny balloon is used to widen the aorta; and having the narrowed area of the aorta surgically removed, which can correct the hypertension.  ###SUMMARYAll right, so, as a quick recap… Aortic coarctation is narrowing of the aorta, resulting in high blood pressure upstream and low pressure downstream. In infant aortic coarctation, the ductus arteriosus remains open after birth and deoxygenated blood goes to the lower extremities causing lower extremity cyanosis. In adults, the coarctation causes issues like a higher risk of berry aneuryms, weak pulse in the lower extremities, hypertension, and rib notching.'],\n",
              "  38: ['The atrial septum separates the right and left atrium of the heart. An atrial septal defect describes when there’s an opening in a baby’s heart between these two upper chambers. But how does this opening form? Well, let’s run through how the septum develops in the first place.When the heart is first developing, a tissue called the septum primum between the left and right atria grows downward, slowly creating two separate chambers by closing this gap, or ostium primum, which means “first opening.” The septum primum then fuses with the endocardial cushion and closes the gap completely. Meanwhile, a hole appears in the upper area, called the ostium secundum, or “second opening.” Now, we also have the septum secundum which grows downward, just to the right of the septum primum, and covers the ostium secundum like a curtain, leaving a small opening called the foramen ovale, thus essentially creating a makeshift valve that allows blood to go from right atrium to left atrium, but not the other way. The developing newborn gets oxygenated blood from the placenta, which goes from the umbilical vein over to the right atrium, which is different because after development, only deoxygenated blood goes to the right atrium, and then gets sent to the lungs to pick up some oxygen. In the developing fetus, though, it’s already oxygenated, so instead of going to the right ventricle and to the lungs and back to the left atrium, it just bypasses the right ventricle and lungs through the foramen ovale and goes into the left atrium. The oxygenated blood then goes to the left ventricle to be pumped to the body.At birth, the septum secundum and septum primum slap shut, and then fuse and close off this foramen ovale so that we can rely on our own lungs for oxygen. An atrial septal defect, or ASD, describes a condition where the septum between the right and left atrium doesn’t close up all the way and remains open even after birth. Most  About 90% of ASD cases are due to the ostium secundum which  can happen when the  secundum septum doesn’t grow enough during development. This actually accounts for about 10-15% of all congenital heart defects and is the most common congenital heart defect in adults. Fewer ASD cases are due to the ostium primum, where the “first opening” doesn’t make it all the way down, again leaving an opening between right and left atria. This primum type of congenital defect is found in around 25% of patients with Down syndrome. In general, atrial septal defects are also commonly associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.Okay, so there’s this opening in the septum; now what? You know how pressure’s higher on the left side than on the right? Well, this pressure difference causes blood to be shunted from the left atrium to the right atrium, meaning more oxygenated blood gets over to the right side, which is usually deoxygenated blood. This type of defect is an acyanotic heart defect, which means “not blue,” because oxygenated blood is going into pulmonary circulation and essentially taking an extra trip to the lungs. In contrast, a cyanotic heart defect allows deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and make it out to the body, causing a blue or purplish discoloration of the skin, which is not the case here. That being the case, you’ll see an increase in oxygen saturation of blood in the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery. This extra blood volume passing by the pulmonic valve also causes a delay in the closure of the pulmonic valve relative to the aortic valve closure. This slight delay can be heard via auscultation as a splitting of the S2 sound, as well as a systolic murmur in some cases.One potential complication for patients with an ASD is if the patient develops an embolus — let’s say a blood clot, because that’s the most common type — that makes its way through the ASD. So, if we take the example of a person with a deep vein thrombosis, part of that blood clot might break loose and become an embolus. Usually, this guy would travel into the right atrium, then right ventricle, and then be pumped off to the lungs and lodge somewhere in the lung. It’s possible that the embolus crosses over to the left side, in which case it can enter the systemic circuit and potentially lodge in the brain. This situation is called paradoxical embolism; it’s paradoxical because the embolus starts off in the right side, but crosses over into the left side.Sometimes, children with ASDs will be monitored for a little while because smaller openings may close on their own. In other cases, especially for larger openings, surgery — which typically involves plugging or patching the opening — will be performed to prevent complications in the future.### SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… An atrial septal defect is a congenital heart defect where the septum between the right and left atrium doesn’t close up all the way and remains open after birth. This causes oxygenated blood to go into pulmonary circulation. One complication from this condition is a paradoxical embolus, which crosses from the right to the left side via the ASD. '],\n",
              "  39: ['The heart has four chambers: two upper chambers, the right and left atrium; and two lower chambers, the right and left ventricles. Fibrillation describes when the muscle fibers are all contracting at different times, so the end result is a quivering, or twitching movement.   Normally, an electrical signal is sent out from the sinus node in the right atrium. The signal then propagates out through both atria super fast, which allows them to depolarize at about the same time, so that you end up with a nice, coordinated contraction of the atria. That signal then moves down to the ventricles and causes them to contract shortly after.   With Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib or AF, signals move around the atria in a completely disorganized way that tends to override the sinus node. Instead of one big contraction, you get all these mini contractions that make it look like the atria are just quivering.   On an  electrocardiogram, or ECG, normally the “P wave” corresponds to the atrial contraction. The “QRS complex,” which is the ventricular contraction, follows shortly after. During AF, all these small areas contract at different times so that you end up with an electrocardiogram that looks like scribbles, where each little peak corresponds to one spot in the atria twitching. Sometimes, a signal from one of these areas makes it down to the ventricles and cause ventricular contraction; these QRS complexes are interspersed at irregular intervals though, and usually at fairly high rates between 100 and 175 beats per minute.   In the normal heartbeat, a well-coordinated atrial contraction contributes a small amount of blood that’s called the “atrial kick.” People with AF lose this atrial kick; however, this loss isn’t life-threatening.  Okay, but how or why does this happen in the atrium? Why do the cells start depolarizing in a totally uncoordinated way? Well, the answer isn’t super cut-and-dry. There are a ton of risk factors that predispose someone to developing AF, and the exact mechanisms aren’t well understood. AF often happens alongside other cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, valvular diseases — essentially anything that can create an inflammatory state or physically stretch out the atria and potentially damage the cells in the atria. Other, non-cardiovascular risk factors include: obesity, diabetes, and excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, there also seems to be a genetic component.  These factors likely stress the cells in the atria, which can lead to tissue heterogeneity; or in other words, cells start taking on different electrical properties. For example, one cell might start conducting signals faster than its neighbor, and another cell might develop a shorter refractory period — the time following depolarization during which they can’t conduct another signal. These different tissue properties can ultimately cause the conduction in the atria to become unpredictable.  Normally, with tissue that’s the same, you’ll get essentially one wavefront of conduction that moves through the atria. According to the multiple wavelet theory, with different tissue properties, multiple wavelets develop. These wavelets conduct randomly around the atria, sometimes colliding and creating new “daughter wavelets.”   Along with the multiple wavelet theory, there’s also an automatic focus theory. According to the automatic focus theory, there’s a specific origin that is thought to initiate AF by rapid firing of electrical impulses that overtake the sinus node. Combined with risk factors and tissue heterogeneity, this can promote AF. It’s thought that a focused group of cells conduct cells in the cardiac muscle around pulmonary veins — yeah, pulmonary veins! Remember that these veins physically enter the left atrium, and where the pulmonary veins enter there is tissue that has really unique electrical properties.   Oftentimes, people with AF start by experiencing paroxysmal events, which means AF suddenly comes and goes, lasting less than a week at a time, probably because the tissue is still relatively healthy. Repeated paroxysmal events that occur over longer periods of time tend to stress the atrial cells even more. There are probably a number of mechanisms explaining how a burst of rapid beats from one of these paroxysmal events leads to stress; for example, one of these potential mechanisms is calcium overload.Over time, the cells in the atrium seem to undergo progressive fibrosis or scarring from this stress. When this happens, the AF episode isn’t able to spontaneously terminate, and patients have persistent AF, which is AF that lasts more than a week without self-terminating.Persistent AF episodes can last for quite a long time — weeks to months — and when the AF episodes last beyond 12 months, it’s known as long-standing persistent AF.  When the patient and clinician make a joint decision not to attempt to stop the rhythm it is called “Permanent AF.”  Common symptoms of AF are feelings of general fatigue, because the heart rate isn’t governed by the sinus node anymore, and contracts at irregular intervals, so that blood is delivered less effectively to the tissues. Other related symptoms include dizziness, shortness of breath, and weakness. A patient might also feel palpitations or “thumping” in their chest.  One potential complication of AF is stroke. When the atria don’t contract as a single unit, but just sort of quiver, the blood that sits in the atria becomes stagnant. When blood stays still, it tends to form clots. With AF, it’s possible that blood clots form which then travel into the ventricles and are pumped off to the body, and potentially to the brain, where they can lodge. This cuts off blood flow to that part of the brain, which is a type of stroke.  Now, diagnosis of persistent AF is done by electrocardiogram. However, if the episodes are paroxysmal, but suspected, then someone might have a holter monitor, which is a portable device placed on the chest that monitors their rhythm over longer periods of time and records potential AF events to be viewed later.   Since AF is caused by such a diverse range of issues, treatment is generally different from patient to patient. Certain medications that help control the heart rate might be given, or medications that reduce the likelihood of blood clot formation, and therefore prevent stroke. Also, patients might receive an implantable cardiac pacemaker, which by constantly pacing the atrium can reduce the chance of an AF episode. Finally, some patients may have a radiofrequency catheter ablation, where certain areas of tissue are destroyed so that the electrical signal doesn’t propagate any more. One type of procedure is the “maze procedure” where a maze of new pathways are created to help electrical impulses move in a more consistent and predictable pattern.   Sometimes, patients will have the ablation of the AV node, essentially cutting off any communication between the two. Since the ventricles aren’t getting any input anymore though, these patients need an implantable pacemaker to make sure the ventricles contract at high enough rates.   ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Atrial fibrillation is when the heart’s muscle fibers contract at different times, resulting in an inconsistent, quivering heartbeat. The condition is comorbid with many other conditions, so it has many different possible causes, and can lead to fatigue, diziness, general weakness, or even a stroke. '],\n",
              "  40: ['The heart has two upper chambers, which are called the atria, and a premature atrial contraction, or PAC, is when the atria contract earlier than normal in the cardiac cycle. So normally, the sinoatrial, or SA, node sends an electrical signal called a depolarization that propagates out through the walls of the heart and causes both upper chambers to contract. Then, that signal moves to the atrioventricular, or AV, node, where it’s delayed for a split second. Then, the signal travels down into the ventricles, or lower chambers, where it moves down the bundle of His into the left and right bundle branches and into each ventricle’s Purkinje fibers, causing them to contract as well. This trip is called a depolarization wave, and in a healthy heart, it makes sure that the upper chambers contract before the lower chambers contract. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which measures the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes that are placed on the skin, the atrial depolarization and its contraction are seen as a P-wave, the ventricular contraction is seen as a QRS complex, and the ventricular repolarization and its relaxation are seen as a T-wave. If an atrial cell outside of the SA node initiates a depolarization, that’s called an atrial ectopic focus. Now, this could be initiated by a cell that’s part of the conduction system, or it could just be initiated by another cardiac muscle cell. This typically happens when atrial cells are irritated and stressed by electrolyte imbalances, drugs like cocaine or methamphetamines, ischemic damage like a heart attack, or anything that increases sympathetic activity, like anxiety. Another type of atrial ectopic focus is a reentrant loop, which is when there’s some tissue that doesn’t depolarize properly, which could happen in scar tissue after a heart attack. As a result of this damage, the depolarization wave ends up circling around and around that tissue. A reentrant loop basically starts sending out depolarization waves to the rest of the heart tissue each time the wave goes around. So, in short, a particularly stressed out atrial cell or a reentrant loop can send out depolarization waves that contract the atria too quickly, and that’s an early, or premature, atrial contraction. One important effect of premature depolarization is that the ectopic focus will depolarize the cells of the SA node, which causes the SA node to skip a cycle. So, let’s say the SA node is working as usual, but, all of a sudden, an ectopic focus fires off a depolarization early. Now, if we measure out the interval between each SA node fire, we see that the SA node should have fired here, but it doesn’t because it was depolarized by the ectopic focus. This means that the SA node essentially skips one cycle of sending its own signal. So, the sinus node waits to fire for the same interval that it normally would, but it also fires based on the ectopic beat. This means that that you end up with an interval with two sinus beats and an ectopic beat in the middle, and that interval is shorter than an interval that’s three sinus beats in a row. This shorter interval is called a noncompensatory pause, where the distance from sinus P-wave to the ectopic P-wave to the next sinus P-wave is less than the distance from the sinus P-wave to sinus P-wave to sinus P-wave.The location of the ectopic focus in the atria determines how the heart contracts and therefore what the ECG looks like.  If the ectopic focus is at the bottom of the atria, then the P-wave will be upside-down. This is because instead of flowing from the top of the atria to the bottom, which is how depolarization normally spreads, the electricity flows in the opposite direction, i.e. from the bottom of the atria to the top.Also, the closer the ectopic focus is to the AV node, the shorter the PR interval, which is the time from the P-wave to the QRS complex, will be. This is because the wave will have a shorter distance to travel. If the heart is beating fast enough, the P-wave from the premature atrial contraction might happen at the same time as the T-wave from the previous, normal contraction. In this case, the two waves will combine, making that T-wave look peaked, which means that it’s just a bit more lumpy than usual, kind of like a camel’s hump.The timing of the PAC will also determine how the heart contracts and therefore what the ECG will look like. When the depolarization wave from an atrial ectopic focus gets to the AV node, there are a few things that could happen. If the AV node is receptive, the signal will be conducted down to the ventricles, resulting in a normal QRS complex. However, if a depolarization wave from an atrial ectopic focus gets through the AV node but is sent through the ventricles abnormally, like when a bundle branch is in refractory, this will lead to an aberrant signal. Most often, the aberrancy is due to a right bundle branch block because that’s the bundle branch that has a longer refractory period. In this situation, the depolarization wave conducts down the left bundle branch and then through the ventricles aberrantly, resulting in an abnormally wide QRS complex. Now, in both of these situations, the QRS complex comes in early, which means we’ve got an early ventricular contraction. So, the heart didn’t have time to fill with as much blood as it normally would, and when it doesn’t fill as much, it doesn’t stretch as much. Therefore, the heart doesn’t pump as strongly as it normally would.Finally, the depolarization from an atrial ectopic focus might reach the AV node while it’s still in refractory, and this means that the signal won’t be conducted at all. In this case, there’s no QRS complex or ventricular contraction. Even here, though, the SA node is reset, and, once again, one cycle later, the SA node will fire a tiny bit early since it’s been reset by the atrial ectopic focus, and that will be followed by a normal looking QRS complex. In this scenario, the ventricles are filling with blood the whole time, and so the ventricle ends up being a bit overfilled and stretches more than it normally would. This results in a really strong contraction, often called a palpitation, that people can often feel.Sometimes, premature atrial contractions can keep happening rather than being isolated events. When a premature atrial contraction consistently occurs after each normal cardiac cycle, it’s called atrial bigeminy. When one consistently occurs after every two normal cardiac cycles, it’s called atrial trigeminy. This so-called “group beating” can be differentiated from a Type 1 second-degree atrioventricular heart block by identifying the abnormally shaped P-waves that characterize an atrial ectopic focus.Most people with premature atrial contractions don’t actually notice any symptoms. If premature atrial contractions keep occurring, though, they can cause lightheadedness because less blood is being delivered to the brain. People might also feel palpitations. In rare situations, an ectopic focus can trigger atrial fibrillation, which is a more serious arrhythmia where the atria essentially just quiver instead of pumping.Premature atrial contractions are diagnosed with an ECG, which will show an early and abnormal looking P-wave and, potentially, an early QRS as well. Sometimes a Holter monitor, which is like a continuous ECG monitor used over a few days, is needed to capture the event.Typically, treatment for premature atrial contractions isn’t required. However, if there’s an obvious cause, like medication or use of a substance, then stopping this will typically resolve the issue. If the premature atrial contractions keep happening or cause palpitations, they can be treated with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, both of which prevent the heart from beating too strongly. If an ectopic focus is triggering atrial fibrillation, radiofrequency ablation can be done, which is where radiofrequency waves are used to destroy the tissue that’s causing the ectopic heartbeat. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: a premature atrial contraction is when the atria contract too early because of depolarization from an ectopic focus. The ECG will show an early and abnormal P-wave, as well as one of three patterns, depending on when the PAC occurs: normal ventricular conduction, aberrant ventricular conduction, or a conduction block.

              "  41: ['The atria are the heart’s upper chambers; the ventricles are the lower chambers. Reentrant tachycardias are fast heart rates caused by electrical signals that loop back on themselves.  Normally, an electrical signal starts at the sinoatrial or SA node in the right atrium and propagates out through both atria, including bachmann’s bundle in the left atrium, and then contracts both atria. It’s then delayed just a little bit as it goes through the atrioventricular, or AV node, before it passes through the Bundle of His and on to the Purkinje fibers of the left and right ventricles, causing them to contract as well.Usually, the only place where a signal can go from the atria to the ventricles is at the AV node, and once that signal gets to the purkinje fibers, it stops and the heart tissue waits for another signal from the SA node. With an atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, or AVRT, the electrical signal actually uses a separate accessory pathway to get back up from the ventricles to the atria, which causes the atria to contract before the SA node sends out another signal. The signal then moves back down the AV node to the ventricles and purkinje fibers, contracts the ventricles, and goes back up that accessory pathway. This cycle repeats, which is why AVRT can result in rates as high as 200-300 bpm. This type of tachycardia is known as a supraventricular tachycardia because the signal causing the fast rate originates above the ventricles. The most common type of AVRT is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where the accessory pathway is called the Bundle of Kent. This type of reentry is known as an anatomical reentrant circuit because the accessory pathway is a fixed, anatomically-defined pathway.   Another type of reentrant circuit is atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, or AVNRT. AVNRT, just like AVRT, is a type of supraventricular tachycardia; however, with AVNRT it’s in or near the AV node, which similarly contracts the ventricle and the atria every time it goes around.   Specifically, there are two separate electrical pathways that make up this loop. One of these pathways has heart tissue that has slow electrical conduction; it’s called the alpha pathway. The other has fast conduction; it’s called the beta pathway. Additionally, the alpha pathway has a short refractory period, which is the time it takes to conduct another signal. The beta pathway, on the other hand, has a long refractory period. Once you have all these things, you’ve got yourself a recipe for AVNRT.   So, let’s say a signal comes down from the SA node in the right atrium, the signal goes down the fast pathway, and reaches the other end before the slow pathway. Next, it splits to travel down to the ventricles, as well as up the alpha pathway, where it meets the slow signal and they both cancel each other out.   At this point, both enter into their refractory period. Because the alpha pathway is shorter, it comes out of refractory sooner and is ready for another signal, while the beta pathway’s still in refractory. So, if another signal comes by, it’ll start down the slow pathway, but since the fast is still in refractory, it’ll be blocked.  At some point while the signal’s going down the alpha side, that beta side will come out of refractory, and then it’ll be ready to go. So, now as the signal exits the alpha pathway to the ventricles and enters the refractory period, it also travels up the beta pathway, and by the time it reaches the alpha pathway again, that pathway’s out of refractory!  Now you have a reentrant loop that keeps going and going, and every time around it causes both an atrial and a ventricular contraction, which again just like AVRT, leads to high ventricular rates. This particular setup, where it goes down the slow pathway, or anterograde, and up the fast pathway, or retrograde, is called slow-fast AVNRT, or typical AVNRT.   However, it’s also possible to have the opposite, called fast-slow AVNRT or atypical AVNRT, which, as the name suggests, is a lot less common than slow-fast AVNRT. With this type, the pathway goes down the fast pathway, or anterograde, and up the slow pathway, or retrograde.  The tachycardia with AVRT and AVNRT typically doesn’t last very long, and both are rarely life-threatening. They both can produce symptoms including: palpitations; shortness of breath; feelings of dizziness; and syncope or fainting, in rare cases.  On an ECG, the P wave is the signal from atrial contraction, and the QRS is the signal from ventricular contraction. On an ECG with AVNRT, the P waves might not be visible because the signal gets to the atria and ventricles at almost the same time, so the P wave starts essentially where the QRS starts, and when you add them together, the P wave can get buried under the QRS complex. With AVRT, the P waves may or may not be buried, depending on where the accessory pathway is located.   The definitive treatment for both AVRT and AVNRT is radio catheter ablation. For AVRT, this means destruction of the accessory pathway. For AVNRT,  this means destruction of the slow, or alpha, pathway. Sometimes for AVNRT, people can use vagal maneuvers to activate the vagus nerve, which tends to block the AV node temporarily, therefore potentially stopping the episode. Some methods to do this include a carotid sinus massage and a valsalva maneuver, which is forced exhalation against a closed airway. Also, they may use medications to slow AV node conduction. In rare cases, when other treatments haven’t been effective, they might need cardioversion.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Reentrant tachycardias are fast heart rates caused by electrical signals that loop back on themselves. With AVRT, the electrical signal uses an accessory pathway to get back from the ventricles to the atria, whereas with AVNRT, the reentrant signal involves two pathways in or near the AV node. Both are rarely life threatening but can produce symptoms like palpitations and shortness of breath.'],\n",
              "  42: ['Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or WPW, is a type of heart arrhythmia caused by an accessory pathway, or an extra electrical conduction pathway, connecting the atria and ventricles, or the upper and lower chambers of the heart.Normally, an electrical signal starts at the sinoatrial node, or SA node, in the right atrium. It then propagates out through both atria, including bachmann’s bundle in the left atrium, and contracts both atria. Then, it’s delayed just a little bit as it goes through the atrioventricular node, or AV node, before it passes through the Bundle of His and to the Purkinje fibers of the left and right ventricles, causing them to contract as well.   On an electrocardiogram, the P-wave corresponds to atrial contraction, the PR interval corresponds to the slight delay through the AV node, and the QRS complex corresponds to ventricular contraction.Now, in a normal electrical conduction system, the AV node is the only place where the signal can get through to the ventricles from the atria. It’s kind of like there’s a gatekeeper that has to stop the signal and make sure everything’s good before letting it pass, so there’s always a slight delay here. People with WPW essentially have a secret, backdoor entrance. Because this entrance is secret, it doesn’t have a gatekeeper; therefore, there’s no delay as the signal moves through it. This secret backdoor entrance is a tiny bundle of cardiac tissue that conducts electrical signals really well, called the Bundle of Kent. Using the Bundle of Kent means the ventricles start to contract a little bit early, which is called pre-excitation. If the Bundle is on the left side of the heart, it’s called “type A pre-excitation.” If it’s on the right side, it’s called “type B pre-excitation.” Type A, on the left side, is a lot more common.   All right, even though one signal sneaks through early, the other signal waiting at the AV node eventually makes its way through, and the two signals essentially combine to contract the ventricles. So, on an ECG, people with WPW have a short PR interval with a delta wave, as well as QRS prolongation, which makes sense because the signal’s taking the shortcut and contracting the ventricles early. This means the PR interval is shorter, and the overall QRS complex is longer. People with WPW usually have a PR interval less than 120 ms and a QRS complex greater than 110 ms. Also, the ST segment and T wave, which represent repolarization, will often be directly opposite the QRS complex. This WPW pattern doesn’t typically cause any symptoms and is relatively benign.  However, in some cases, this pattern can facilitate certain arrhythmias, make certain arrhythmias more severe, and potentially even cause sudden cardiac death. When this happens, it’s called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. For example, people with atrial arrhythmias might have atrial rates in the 200 to 300 beats per minute range. Normally, the AV node doesn’t allow all of these signals through, and so the ventricles will contract at a lower number; for example, for every three atrial beats, there’s only one ventricular beat, so for 300 beats per minute in the atrium, the ventricle would go for 100 beats per minute.   For people with a Bundle of Kent, however, those signals aren’t held up at the AV node, so the ventricles contract at the same rate as the atrium; in our example, that’s at 300 beats per minute, which is way too fast for the ventricles. This can quickly lead to cardiogenic shock because the heart doesn’t even have time to fill with blood before each contraction; it’s barely pumping any blood.  In other cases, the extra pathway can set up a reentry circuit. In the event of a reentry circuit, the signal might move back up the accessory pathway, because the majority of Bundles of Kent are actually bidirectional, which means that the signal can go from atrium to ventricle as well as from ventricle to atrium. For example, an electrical signal could go down the AV node, through the ventricles, and then up the Bundle of Kent, causing the atria to contract, and then go back down the AV node, contracting the ventricles again; next, it would go back up the Bundle of Kent, creating a reentry circuit. This type, where the signal goes from ventricle to atrium, is called Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, or AVRT, with orthodromic conduction; this can lead to very high ventricular rates between 200 and 300 bpm.  Less commonly, the signal can move in the opposite direction, which is called AVRT with antidromic conduction. These circuits can be initiated by several mechanisms, such as premature contractions in the atria or ventricles.  It’s estimated that about one in 1000 people have Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, which is congenital and present at birth. A small proportion of this already small number go on to have the symptoms that we just discussed.   If they do develop dangerous tachyarrhythmias, they may be treated pharmacologically, but a definitive treatment is radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway, or the Bundle of Kent. This treatment uses cautery to destroy the pathway, essentially boarding up the secret back door, which leaves behind only one connection between the atria and the ventricles: the AV node.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, or WPW,  is a congenital disorder where there is an extra electrical conduction pathway, called the bundle of Kent, connecting the atria and ventricles, which can set up a reentry circuit, and facilitate or worsen certain arrhythmias. Severe WPW syndrome may be treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway.'],\n",
              "  43: ['Ventricular refers to the bottom chambers of the heart, the right and left ventricles, as opposed to the top chambers, the right and left atria. Tachycardia refers to a fast heart rate. Typically, a tachycardic, or fast, heart rate is considered anything above 100 beats per minute, or bpm. However, ventricular tachycardia is different than a fast heart rate from exercising, which is called sinus tachycardia. Normally, the electrical signals that generate each heartbeat start in the right atrium at the sinus node, which is also known as the sinoatrial node, or the SA node. If the rate goes over 100 bpm and originates in the SA node, it’s considered sinus tachycardia, which is totally normal.However, heartbeats can become abnormal if the electrical signals don’t start in the SA node, but start in the ventricles instead. Premature Ventricular Contractions, or PVCs, are single beats originating from the lower chambers. Any time there are more than three beats like this in a row, then it’s defined as ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia, sometimes called V-tach, or VT, can cause the heart rate to rise above 100 beats per minute, which can be extremely dangerous and lead to sudden cardiac death.Hold on, how can that happen? It’s not like while we exercise we’re risking sudden cardiac death, right? Well, even though we say tachycardia is anything above 100 beats per minute, most patients with ventricular tachycardia experience heart rates as high as 250 beats per minute. 250 beats per minute mean that the heart is beating over four times per second.  When the chambers are pumping that fast, they don’t have enough time to even fill with blood, so the heart is furiously pumping out only tablespoons of blood to your body, and most importantly, to your brain, which is just not enough. If this happens, a person can have symptoms from not having enough perfusion to their tissues, such as chest pain, fainting, dizziness, or shortness of breath. It can even cause sudden death.   Now, there are essentially two ways an electrical signal can start in a ventricle: either the signal is focal, or it’s reentrant. Focal V-tach happens when a specific area of the ventricle has abnormal automaticity. The automaticity rate is the frequency at which a cell sends out a signal, so for the pacemaker cells in the SA node, the rate is between about 60 and 100 signals per minute, resulting in 60 to 100 beats per minute. Let’s just say 60 beats per minute, so one beat every second. Some specialized pacemaker cells in the ventricles also have this ability; they’re just usually a lot slower, making about 30 beats per minute, or one beat every two seconds. So, in most cases, the SA node fires signals off a lot faster, which sends electrical waves throughout the atria and ventricles. This doesn’t give the ventricular pacemaker cells a chance to ever have just two seconds of peace, which is what they need before they fire at a rate of 30 bpm.   For example, imagine all the other pacemaker cells stopped suddenly. After two seconds, the ventricular cells would initiate a signal, right? Now, if a certain area of ventricular tissue gets stressed or irritated in some way, the ventricular pacemaker cells might start firing at higher rates. They essentially flip roles with the SA node, firing so fast that the pacemaker cells in the SA node don’t get a chance to fire; at this point, the heartbeat is being driven by the ventricles. This stress might be triggered by: certain medications; illicit drugs, such as methamphetamine or cocaine; electrolyte imbalances; and ischemia to the ventricular muscle.   However, it’s more common for V-tach to be reentrant, as opposed to focal. So, let’s take a closer look at the cardiomyocytes, or heart muscles cells, instead of the pacemaker cells. These can be stressed in a similar way, which might change a couple of their properties, including how fast they relay, or conduct the signal to the next cell, and how long their refractory period is. Now, the refractory period is the period right after conducting a signal when the cells can’t conduct another signal.   All right, to help explain this, let’s say the myocardial tissue on side A conducts really fast, so the electrical signal zips through; however, it takes a long time to be able to conduct again. In other words, it has a long refractory period. The other side, or side B, is the exact opposite; it has slow conduction and a short refractory period. Now, this isn’t entirely unusual, since the heart can naturally have tissue with different properties. But let’s say that this tissue becomes damaged, and some of these cells actually die, like with a heart attack. Well, now you’ll get some scar tissue, which really can’t conduct the signal as well. Sometimes, this can create a sort of split pathway, where it  goes around the scar and meets back up on the other side. Under these conditions, it’s possible that a reentrant circuit develops. Okay, if one signal comes through, that’s fine. On side A, the wave makes it around first and goes on to the rest of the ventricle, and contracts the ventricle. It also starts up the other path, and sort of runs into the other, slower wave, which is called a unidirectional block.   Now, side A goes into its long refractory period, and side B goes into its short refractory period. Basically, side B comes out of refractory first. If another signal comes early, while side B’s ready but side A isn’t ready, and is still in refractory, it’ll be stopped on the A  side, right?   It’ll move down side B. If, by the time the signal makes it down the slow side B, side A is now out of refractory, the signal can re-enter the circuit, essentially moving up side A. It then gets back to the top of side A, then goes down side B again, basically coming down and going back up again.   This can happen again and again. Every time you go around, you get a ventricular contraction, or a heartbeat! This is what can lead to reentrant ventricular tachycardia.  Now, the type of ventricular tachycardia is diagnosed via electrocardiogram, or ECG. ECGs measure the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes that are placed on the skin. A normal ECG looks something like this, with characteristic waves PQRST, and sometimes U. This big guy in the middle, the QRS complex, represents the depolarization, and therefore the contraction, of the ventricular muscle fibers.   During ventricular tachycardia, you’ll typically see something like this. Each of these represents a ventricular contraction. When they all look the same, it’s called monomorphic, because it just has one morphology, or one form. This is typically the case for reentrant circuits, since there’s only a single spot where everything’s starting from. It’s also the case for focal VTs when one group of cells is responsible.  However, sometimes the VT can be polymorphic, which means that the shape changes from beat to beat because the signal’s originating from different points in the ventricles. Polymorphic VT might happen when multiple areas of pacemaker cells become irritated and develop increased automaticity rates, such as from severe hypoxia, for example.   Having V-tach is very dangerous, and it can develop into another dangerous rhythm called Ventricular fibrillation. Both of these conditions require immediate medical attention. VT is treated with cardioversion; either drug cardioversion or electrical cardioversion can be used. Drug cardioversion involves a drug treatment that aims to lower the heart rate back to a normal rhythm. Electrical cardioversion, on the other hand, uses an electrical pulse of energy delivered to the heart that is synchronized with the fast rate that will be delivered on the R-wave, which is the peak of the QRS complex. This is done to try to avoid delivering it during a vulnerable period on the T wave in which electrical cardioversion could induce ventricular fibrillation. Sometimes, patients might have a radiofrequency catheter ablation, where radiofrequency waves are used to heat up and destroy the tissue that’s causing the irregular heartbeat; this can essentially cure certain tachycardias. Other times, patients prone to having bouts of ventricular tachycardia will have a small device capable of delivering electrical cardioversion called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD, surgically implanted.   ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Ventricular tachycardia, or V-tach, or VT, is a condition where electrical signals generated by abnormal tissue in the ventricles causes it to beat three or more times consecutively, resulting in a heart rate of above 100 beats per minute. Based on how the electrical signal starts, it can either be focal ventricular tachycardia or reentrant ventricular tachycardia, and both require immediate treatment with drug or electrical cardioversion, or radiofrequency catheter ablation.'],\n",
              "  44: ['Brugada syndrome is named after Pedro and Josep Brugada, two cardiologists (and brothers!) who recognized a specific pattern of ventricular fibrillation on the electrocardiogram readings of previously healthy individuals who died suddenly. They discovered that some of these cases could be traced back to a specific genetic cause, and their findings have since been known as Brugada syndrome. Many individuals with Brugada syndrome don’t have an identifiable genetic cause, but in some individuals, the role their genes play is very clearly defined. The most well-known of these genetic causes is a mutation in the gene SCN5A. This SCN5A mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single mutation is enough to cause the disease. SC5NA codes for sodium ion channels in the cell membranes of cardiac muscle cells, and a faulty sodium ion channel affects the ability of these cells to conduct an action potential. The result, then, is that some regions of the heart end up repolarizing abnormally. In some cases, the heart might have a normal rhythm at first, which can then develop into a Brugada syndrome rhythm in the presence of certain medications like sodium channel blockers. On an electrocardiogram, Brugada syndrome typically has ST elevations (which are often a sign of ventricular strain), as well as a right bundle branch block, which indicates that the ventricles aren’t depolarizing normally. As a result, these regions become susceptible to what’s called a reentrant loop, which is when a depolarization signal starts circling around and around in a loop, causing ventricular tachycardia and sometimes ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation, sometimes called v-fib, means the heart’s muscle fibers start quivering because they’re not contracting at the same time. Normally, an electrical signal spreads quickly enough that all the muscle fibers in the ventricles contract at pretty much the same time, which essentially looks like a single, coordinated contraction. If they don’t all contract around the same time, not much gets accomplished. It’s kind of like a rowboat—it works best when everyone rows at the same time, right? Well with v-fib, all the rowers stop rowing together and just row whenever they want, and the rowboat just moves in circles, and eventually sinks. Just like the rowboat, If the heart’s not squeezing anymore, and it’s just squirming around “like a bag of worms”—which is actually the description used to used explain what a heart experiencing v-fib looks like—then you can probably guess that this situation is extremely dangerous. It’s dangerous because your body, and especially your brain, isn’t getting fresh oxygen; because of this, ventricular fibrillation can lead to death within minutes of onset, and this is called sudden cardiac death.Individuals with Brugada syndrome are usually healthy before dying suddenly. In some cases, individuals survive their first episode of an arrhythmia, which might cause palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue, and are then diagnosed after experiencing these symptoms. Other times, when someone dies suddenly of cardiac death, their relatives get gene tested, and the cause of death is unfortunately only determined to be Brugada syndrome post-mortem. Individuals found to have Brugada syndrome while they’re alive can have a cardiac defibrillator implanted, so that it can take over if or when they experience further episodes of ventricular fibrillation.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, Brugada syndrome is usually identified based on an ECG tracing, and can cause sudden cardiac death. Some cases have been linked to a gene mutation in SCN5A, which is responsible for encoding the sodium channels found on cardiac muscle cells. Ultimately, Brugada syndrome can lead to ventricular fibrillation which is when the ventricles contract in an uncoordinated way. Treatment is usually done after someone experiences an episode of ventricular fibrillation for the first time, with a defibrillator being implanted to reduce the likelihood of sudden cardiac death.

              "  45: ['The heart has two lower chambers, called the ventricles, and a premature ventricular contraction is when the ventricles contract earlier than normal in the cardiac cycle. This happens because an abnormal contraction signal, called a depolarization, originates from somewhere in the ventricles rather than coming from the pacemaker cells.So normally, the sinoatrial, or SA, node sends an electrical signal called a depolarization that propagates out through the walls of the heart and causes both upper chambers to contract. Then, that signal moves to the atrioventricular, or AV, node, where it’s delayed for a split second. Then, the signal travels down into the ventricles, or lower chambers, where it moves down the bundle of His into the left and right bundle branches and into each ventricle’s Purkinje fibers, causing them to contract as well. This trip is called a depolarization wave, and in a healthy heart, it makes sure that the upper chambers contract before the lower chambers contract. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which measures the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes that are placed on the skin, the atrial depolarization and its contraction are seen as a P-wave, the ventricular contraction is seen as a QRS complex, and the ventricular repolarization and its relaxation are seen as a T-wave. This empty space is called the PR segment, and it corresponds to the pause in the AV node. This one is called the ST segment, and it corresponds to the interval between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Finally, this one is called the TP segment, which represents the heart’s quiet time, which happens when the cells are finished repolarizing and are ready for another signal. Now, if we just look at the QRS complex, which normally lasts less than 100 milliseconds or 2-and-a-half little boxes, it’s usually made up of three smaller waves, also called deflections. If the first wave after the P-wave is downwards, or negative, it’s called a Q wave, and a way to remember that is by thinking that the letter Q has a downward tail. If the next deflection is upward, or positive, then it’s called the R-wave. However, if the first wave after the P-wave is upwards, or positive,  instead, you basically skip the Q and just called it an R-wave. Finally, any downward deflection after the R-wave is called the S-wave. Now, the interesting thing is that in addition to the pacemaker cells in the SA node, cells in the AV node, Bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers, all have the ability to generate an electrical potential. Those last three are called latent pacemakers, and they have slower depolarization rates — which is the rate at which they fire off electrical signals — and these depolarization rates get slower as you move further down the heart. Let’s use this bar to visualize the SA node’s depolarization rate, which is the fastest, and then each one below is slightly slower. Notice that each time the SA node fires, it resets all the slower ones. If, for example, the SA node stopped firing action potentials altogether, then the AV node would take over at its slightly slower pace. Now, though, let’s say you have an ectopic focus, which is a cell or area of tissue that sends off an early depolarization wave before even the SA node gets to fire, somewhere in the ventricles. This is what leads to a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC.A latent pacemaker cell or cardiac muscle cell could depolarize early if it experiences enhanced automaticity, which might result from irritating stressors like electrolyte imbalances, drugs like cocaine or methamphetamines, ischemic damage like a heart attack, or anything that increases sympathetic activity, like anxiety. Ectopic beats can also be caused by triggered activity, which is when cells depolarize early. The exact mechanism here is unclear, but it might be due an ion channel dysfunction that leads to an unexpected change in the membrane potential during or right after repolarization. When a cell depolarization happens during ventricular repolarization, it’s called an early-afterdepolarization, and if the depolarization happens after repolarization is finished, it’s called a delayed-afterdepolarization. A final type of ventricular ectopic focus is a reentrant loop, where a depolarization wave encounters tissue that doesn’t depolarize, which could happen in scar tissue after a heart. The wave starts going around and around that tissue, forming a reentrant loop. A reentrant loop basically starts sending out depolarization waves to the rest of the heart tissue each time the wave goes around. If the ectopic focus originates in the right ventricle, the depolarization wave will depolarize the right ventricle first and then the left ventricle. This produces a QRS complex that looks like a left bundle branch block. If the ectopic focus originates in the left ventricle, the wave will depolarizing the left ventricle first and then the right ventricle, and this produces a QRS complex that looks like a right bundle branch block. Now, lead V1 on an ECG measures a depolarization wave that moves towards the right ventricle. So, when an ectopic focus originates in the left ventricle and moves towards the right ventricle, the V1 lead shows a large positive complex with a dominating R-wave. When an ectopic focus originates in the right ventricle and then moves towards the left ventricle, the V1 lead shows a large negative complex with a dominating S-wave. Regardless of the originating ventricle, a premature ventricular contraction often has an abnormal T-wave because the timing and direction of repolarization will be abnormal as well.Let’s say that a heart’s cruising along at about 60 beats per minute, which means that there’s one second between P-waves and QRS complexes. All of a sudden, an ectopic focus in the ventricles fires off, contracting the ventricles. That wave of depolarization tries to travel up to the atrium, but because this happens so close to the previous depolarization, the atrium’s still in its refractory period and the wave is stopped at the AV node. A split second later, the ventricle enters its refractory period. Since the sinus node is depolarizing at a rate of one second per beat, and it’s out of refractory, it fires off a signal and the atria contract. This creates another P-wave that’s right on schedule. Because the ventricle’s in refractory now, though, it doesn’t contract. Next, both the atrium and the ventricle relax and come out of refractory. Exactly one second later, the sinus node sends another signal, the atrium contracts as it should, and everything carries on as usual. This situation is called a compensatory pause, which is defined as having a normal sinus complex landing exactly two times the normal sinus interval. Here, the normal sinus interval is one second, so one times two equals two seconds. We end up with a long pause — specifically, one that’s greater than the sinus interval — between ventricular contractions. A longer time between contractions means that the ventricles fill up more, and this means the heart contracts with greater strength, which can be felt as a palpitation.Now, let’s run a slightly different scenario. Here, the premature ventricular contraction occurs after the atrium comes out of refractory. In this case, the wave of depolarization makes it into the atrium and depolarizes the atrium, including the sinus node. Essentially, this means that the sinus node resets about 4.4 boxes, or 0.88 seconds, from the last. In this case, after being depolarized, the sinus node waits its one second, and then sends another signal; again, we carry on as normal. This is called a noncompensatory pause, because the sinus complex lands less than two the normal sinus interval. This is how you can tell whether or not the PVC depolarized the atrium.A ventricular ectopic focus can fire at different points in the cardiac cycle, and this affects how an ECG will look. First, the ectopic focus might fire during a P-wave. Sometimes, this can get completely lost in the QRS complex, but it can sometimes be found if you search for it. Next, the ectopic beat could happen during the PR segment, and because the ectopic depolarization happens relatively slowly, it will often combine with the normal depolarization wave coming down the ventricular conduction system, resulting in a ventricular fusion beat. These can look lots of different ways depending on where the two depolarization waves meet each other. Early after-depolarizations might start during the ST segment or even during the T-wave, and that’s called R-on-T phenomenon. This used to be considered an ominous sign of an impending, dangerous arrhythmia, but recent studies show that the relationship between R-on-T phenomenon and arrhythmia are more complex than we once thought.Sometimes, premature ventricular contractions can keep happening instead of being isolated events. For example, ventricular bigeminy is when a premature ventricular contraction consistently comes after each normal cardiac cycle. Ventricular trigeminy, on the other hand, is when a premature ventricular contraction consistently comes after every two normal cardiac cycles.  Also, you might have multiple ectopic foci premature ventricular contractions that produce differently appearing QRS complexes on a single rhythm strip.Now, most people with premature ventricular contractions don’t notice them, but if these keep occurring, they can cause lightheadedness because less blood is being delivered to the brain. In rare situations, an ectopic focus can trigger ventricular tachycardia or even ventricular fibrillation, which are more serious arrhythmias where the ventricles beat too quickly to fill up with an adequate amount of blood. The diagnosis of a premature ventricular contraction is based on the ECG, but sometimes a Holter monitor, which is like a continuous ECG monitor used over a few days, is needed to capture the event. Typically, premature ventricular contractions don’t need treatment, and if there is an obvious cause, like a particular medication or use of a substance, then stopping that typically resolves the issue.  If the premature ventricular contractions keep happening or cause palpitations, they can be treated with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, both of which prevent the heart from beating too strongly. If an ectopic focus is triggering ventricular arrhythmias, radiofrequency ablation, which is where radiofrequency waves are used to destroy the tissue that’s causing the ectopic heartbeat, can be done. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: premature ventricular contractions are abnormal heartbeats that originate in the ventricles, and they show up as tall and wide QRS complexes on an ECG. They can be caused by abnormal automaticity, reentry loops, or a triggered afterdepolarization. They’re usually asymptomatic, but when they’re a sign of an underlying disorder, treatment including a radiofrequency ablation may be necessary.'],\n",
              "  46: ['Ventricular refers to the bottom chambers of the heart, the right and left ventricles, rather than the top chambers, the right and left atria. Fibrillation means quivering from uncoordinated muscle fiber contraction. So, ventricular fibrillation, sometimes called v-fib or VF, means that the heart’s muscle fibers start quivering because they’re not contracting at the same time.  Normally, an electrical signal spreads fast enough that all the muscle fibers in the ventricles contract at almost the same time, which essentially acts like a single, coordinated contraction. If they don’t all contract at about the same time, not much gets accomplished. It’s kind of like a rowboat; it works best when everyone rows at the same time, right?Well, with VF, all the rowers stop rowing together, and just row whenever they want; the rowboat just moves in circles, and eventually sinks. Just like a rowboat, if the heart’s not squeezing anymore, and it’s just squirming around “like a bag of worms” — a common description of what it looks like — then you can probably guess that this situation is extremely dangerous. Because your body, and especially your brain, isn’t getting fresh oxygen, ventricular fibrillation can lead to death within minutes of onset, which is called sudden cardiac death.  Now, the exact mechanisms leading up to VF aren’t always super clear because it’s hard to know what’s happening in the heart immediately before VF. Most often, however, the heart cells become stressed or damaged in such a way that different areas of tissue are structurally and electrically changed, and thus have different properties; this known as tissue heterogeneity. When they’re homogenous, or the same, they all behave in the same ways and can depolarize and contract at nearly the same time. When the tissues have different electrical properties, they aren’t as good as working together, and are more prone to abnormal behavior and depolarizing on their own. In general, tissue heterogeneity can happen after something stresses the ventricular muscle, such as: certain medications; illicit drugs, like methamphetamine or cocaine; electrolyte imbalances; and ischemia to the ventricular muscle.   When a group of ventricular pacemaker cells starts firing at the wrong time, if the surrounding cells have the same or nearly the same properties, that signal radiates outward simultaneously, causing the ventricles to contract; this is called a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC. Although it is not the norm, it is a relatively benign phenomenon and can even be seen sometimes in otherwise healthy hearts. However, having more than three PVCs in a row is called ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia can sometimes progress to ventricular fibrillation.  In our example, let’s imagine that surrounding cells have very different properties; maybe some cells don’t conduct the signal as fast as other cells. Instead of radiating outward uniformly, the wave of conduction can start to curve, and ultimately ends up literally spiraling out of control; therefore, the wavefront circles back on itself, and initiates another depolarization. This situation is called functional reentry. That spiral can spread and break down into other mini spirals, leading to fibrillation and to the different areas of the heart depolarizing and contracting at different times.   Alternatively, the reentry behavior can start because of the presence of scar tissue, which can happen after a heart attack; because scar tissue isn’t electrically conductive, the signal just goes around and around the scar. In this case it’s known as anatomical reentry.   One last means of inducing fibrillation is through electrocution, or external electrical stimulation. Here’s a normal reading of the heart’s electrical activity, as shown by an electrocardiogram or ECG. We call these waves PQRST, and sometimes U. The QRS complex, right in the middle, corresponds to the ventricles contracting. If the heart tissue is stimulated at just the right time, during the upslope of the T wave, it can actually induce fibrillation.  Right after the ventricles contract, the cells enter into a refractory period, during which they can’t be stimulated to contract again. During the upslope of the T wave, some cells are starting to come out of refractory, so those cells might be ready to go again, whereas other cells might still be in a refractory phase.   Therefore, some cells might contract, and some might not; this can lead to abnormal conduction, which could lead to a similar reentry phenomenon we just talked about.   During VF, the whole PQRST breaks down completely, and all you see are these small “fib waves”; each one corresponds to an area of the ventricle depolarizing on its own. One of the only ways to stop fibrillation once it’s started, unless it breaks on its own, is external electrical stimulation, or defibrillation. This is typically a high-energy shock meant to depolarize at least a large enough portion of heart tissue, or a critical mass, to allow the sinus node, or the heart’s main pacemaker, to take control again. Basically, we’re trying to interfere and stop all the reentry spirals at the same time. It would be similar to the captain of our rowboat getting on the loudspeaker and screaming to get everyone’s attention all at once.  Sometimes, patients might be given an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. ICDs are surgically implanted, and can constantly monitor a patient’s ECG. If the patient’s ECG suddenly breaks down into fib waves, the device recognizes it is as VF, and promptly delivers a defibrillating shock. Patients may also be given medications following a VF event to help reduce the likelihood of episodes in the future. Although ICDs and medication can’t fix the underlying condition that ultimately leads to VF, they have been shown to be very beneficial and effective at improving survival.   ###SUMMARYVentricular fibrillation, sometimes called v-fib or VF, is when there’s quivering of ventricular muscle fibres because they’re not contracting at the same time. This results in failure to pump oxygenated blood to the brain, which within minutes can lead to sudden cardiac death. Ventricular fibrillation can be stopped by electrical stimulation using a defibrillator.'],\n",
              "  47: ['Each heartbeat starts with the heart’s pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, sometimes just called the SA node, in the right atrium. The SA node sends an electrical signal that propagates out through the walls of the heart and contracts both upper chambers, then moves through the atrioventricular node, or AV node, where the signal stops for a split second. Next, the signal goes down into the lower chambers, where it moves down the bundle of His, into the left and right bundle branches, and into each ventricles’ Purkinje fibers, causing them to contract as well. So, in a healthy heart, the upper chambers contract first, and then shortly after, the lower chambers contract.   On an ECG, the atrial contraction is seen as a “P wave,” and the ventricular contraction is seen as the “QRS complex.” The interval from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex is called the “PR interval,” and is normally between 120 and 200 milliseconds, or 3-5 tiny boxes on the graph paper that it’s usually printed out on, since each box is 40 milliseconds or 0.04 seconds. Heart block describes a type of arrhythmia, or abnormal rhythm, that happens when the electrical signal gets delayed or blocked entirely at some point along the conduction system.  These blocks and delays usually happen because of some sort of damage or fibrosis to the electrical conduction system, the pathways that conduct the electrical signal. Lev’s disease, or Lenegre-lev syndrome, describes the large proportion of cases that are idiopathic and described as progressive cardiac conduction defects. This means it’s not clear exactly what causes it, but over time fibrosis, or scarring, develops in the conduction system which can delay or stop electrical conduction. This is usually a result of the aging process in the heart, and happens most often in the elderly, although some hereditary forms have been identified and can happen in younger people. However, another large proportion of cases are a result of ischemic heart disease, which is when the heart cells don’t receive enough oxygen and can die off, as with a heart attack. This again leaves scar tissue that can block the electrical signal. In fact, it’s estimated that about 20 percent of patients that have a heart attack go on to develop a heart block.   Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the electrical conduction system is kind of like the electrical wiring in the walls of a house, so it makes sense that diseases of the heart muscle walls — or, cardiomyopathies — and inflammation of the heart muscle — or, myocarditis — can both cause heart block.  An atrioventricular, or AV block, describes when the signal is delayed or blocked when it’s trying to move from the atria to the ventricles. First-degree AV block is when the signal is delayed, but still makes it to the ventricles. This type has a PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds. Even though these signals are delayed, in first degree block, they still reach the ventricles. First degree block isn’t usually associated with any symptoms. Treatment or management of first degree block might involve identifying electrolyte imbalances or causes due to medications, but it usually doesn’t require further treatment.  Second degree AV block can be split into two types. Type I, called “Mobitz I,” or sometimes “Wenckebach,” happens when the PR interval gets progressively longer with each beat until a P wave is blocked completely. So, maybe the first PR interval is 200 ms, then the next is 260 ms, then 300 ms, and finally the next one doesn’t make it to the ventricles, and you get what’s called a “dropped beat.”   When a signal doesn’t make it to the ventricles from the atria, and if a long enough time passes by — let’s say about 2 seconds — then the ventricles’ pacemaker cells kick in, sort of as a fail-safe mechanism, called a ventricular escape beat. Most people with this type don’t have symptoms, but occasionally patients feel lightheadedness, dizziness, and syncope.   Second degree AV block, called Type II, or “Mobitz II,” is similar to Type I AV block in that you get intermittent dropped beats. However, this time they happen fairly randomly, so you don’t have the progressive lengthening of the PR interval. A lot of times, a ratio for the overall number of beats conducted to not-conducted is given, like 2:1 Mobitz II AV block, but again, remember that the dropped beats happen fairly randomly so we can’t really predict exactly when the next beat will get dropped. Most people with Mobitz Type II do feel symptoms, such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope, though the severity can vary from patient to patient. Third degree, or complete heart block, describes when the signal is completely blocked while moving from the atria to ventricles, every time. So in this case, even though the atria might be going along at 60 bpm as if everything was normal, none of those signals make it down to the ventricles, and the ventricles struggle along with escape beats at very slow rates, probably closer to 30 bpm. Patients with complete heart block are usually symptomatic, with symptoms such as syncope, confusion, dyspnea, and severe chest pain. These patients are at risk of dying.When someone has AV block, it’s important to find out the underlying cause and address it. For example, it could be an adverse effect from a medication or from an infection. In terms of treating the AV block, typically a medication can be used to increase the heart rate, like atropine. Alternatively, transcutaneous pacing might be used, where electrical pacing of the heart is done through electrodes placed on the skin. If the underlying cause is irreversible and the AV block is severe, patients ultimately might need a permanent pacemaker, which is implanted to continually monitor the patient’s rhythm. If it detects a delay, it’ll send an electrical impulse into the ventricles, causing them to contract.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Atrioventricular block is a type of arrhythmia where the signal is delayed or blocked when moving from the atria to the ventricles. It is caused by Lev’s disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or myocarditis, and can be one of three types depending on its severity. At its most severe, the signal is completely blocked, with symptoms like syncope, dyspnea, and severe chest pain. '],\n",
              "  48: ['Each heartbeat starts with the heart’s pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, sometimes called the SA node, in the right atrium. The SA node sends out an electrical signal that propagates out and contracts both upper chambers. The signal then moves through the atrioventricular node, or AV node, down into the lower chambers. Here it reaches the bundle of His and splits into the left and right bundle branches, which serve the left and the right ventricles. The signal then goes on to each ventricles’ Purkinje fibers, which leads to ventricular contraction.Now, a “bundle branch block” describes when that electrical signal gets completely blocked or held up along one of the bundle branches. In most cases, this block, or delay, is caused by fibrosis, or scarring, that either occurs acutely or chronically. Acute causes can be things like ischemia, heart attack, or myocarditis, the inflammation of the heart tissue. Chronic conditions might lead to fibrosis of the heart tissue, because they all can cause slow and steady remodeling of the heart muscle; these include: hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathies.  If the block happens on the right side, it’s referred to as a right bundle branch block. With this type, the electrical signal starts at the SA node, contracts the atria, moves through the AV node, splits at the bundle of His, and then moves down the left bundle branch, but is blocked on the right bundle branch. This causes the left ventricle to contract first. The signal then spreads from the purkinje fibers of the left ventricle over to the right ventricle, which causes the right ventricle to contract after the left has contracted. So, with right bundle branch block, the right ventricle contracts late. If the block happened to be on the left side instead, which is called a left bundle branch block, the signal would be delayed on that side, and so the right ventricle would contract first, and then the left ventricle would contract late.Now, on electrocardiogram or ECG, normally you have the characteristic P wave, which corresponds to the atria contracting, then the QRS complex, which corresponds to both ventricles contracting and is usually between 80 and 100 ms long. If there’s a delay in depolarization of one of the ventricles, the QRS complex gets wider because depolarization starts on time but ends later than usual. Because now one of the ventricles is contracting late, a QRS complex longer than 120 ms is common to see in a bundle branch block. Okay, so far we’ve been looking a relatively common view of the heart, called lead two, which is a type of “limb lead,” since we get it by attaching leads to two limbs: the right arm and left leg. Even though this lead can provide some solid information, it’s often helpful to use other leads as well, especially when differentiating between left and right bundle branch block. The chest leads, or precordial leads, are really useful for doing just that. Chest leads look at the heart’s electrical activity when viewed from a slice parallel with the ground, whereas limb leads look at the heart in the frontal plane, which is perpendicular to the ground.For chest leads, they go from V1, coming straight out the front of the chest, to V6, going out the left side of the chest. Each of these is like looking at the heart from a different perspective, right? V1 and V6 are particularly helpful since they’re the farthest apart from each other, and therefore have the most contrast between views. Normally, the first thing to depolarize is the septum, and the wave of depolarization moves from the left bundle branch toward the right ventricle, so toward V1 but away from V6. This  means you’ll get a positive deflection on V1, and a negative deflection on V6. Next, that wave moves to the ventricles themselves, and since the left ventricle is usually more massive, you’ll get a large depolarization directed away from V1 but toward V6, so negative on V1 and positive on V6. Let’s say there’s a block along the left bundle branch, so now the overall direction of depolarization comes from the right side and moves toward the left, so away from V1 and toward V6, meaning negative in V1 and positive in V6. V6 will also often be notched from the left ventricle, depolarizing late. So, when it’s all said and done, V1 usually has a QS or “little r”-S complex, because QS means an absent R wave, and “little r”-S means a small R wave, either of which give it a “W” shape. On V6, the large “notched” R wave gives it an “M” shape.  All right, now let’s say there’s a block on the right bundle branch. The first part is actually similar to the normal situation, so the septum depolarizes from the left bundle branch toward the right ventricle, so toward and positive in V1, and away and negative in V6. Next, the left ventricle depolarizes and you get a negative deflection in V1 and a positive deflection in V6. Finally, as the right ventricle depolarizes in a roundabout sort of way, you get a positive deflection in V1 and negative in V6. So, V1 has a large terminal R wave, meaning it ends with a large R wave, and this gives it an ‘M’ shape. On V6, there should be a slurred S wave, giving it a W shape. Now, if we take a look at all these, you’ve got W-shape in V1 and M-shape in V6 for left bundle branch block, but an  M-shape in V1 and a W-shape in V6 in right bundle branch block, which gives us this awesome mnemonic: WiLLiaM MaRRoW. Nailed it.  Some cases of bundle branch block are present since birth, don’t cause symptoms, and therefore probably don’t need treatment. In a lot of cases though, the block is acquired through some other heart disease. In severe cases, when the block is accompanied by heart failure, a special cardiac resynchronization pacemaker can be implanted that has electrical leads going to both the left and right ventricles.These leads can pace the ventricles at the same time, causing them both to contract at the same time, which helps improve cardiac function.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… A bundle branch block is when the electrical signal from the AV node gets blocked or delayed along one of the bundle branches in the ventricles. It is usually caused by fibrosis of heart tissue from acute or chronic heart disease. It shows up as a wider QRS complex on an ECG, and using chest leads on the ECG can help confirm the bundle block’s location. '],\n",
              "  49: ['The tricuspid valve has three leaflets: the anterior, posterior and medial or septal leaflets. Together, these separate the right atrium from the right ventricle. During systole, or muscle contraction, the tricuspid valve closes, and during diastole, or heart relaxation, the tricuspid valve opens and lets blood fill the right ventricle. Tricuspid valve regurgitation happens when the tricuspid valve doesn’t close completely and blood leaks back from the right ventricle into the right atrium. Tricuspid valve stenosis happens if the tricuspid valve can’t open completely, making it difficult to fill the right ventricle.Let’s start with tricuspid valve regurgitation. Often, regurgitation is due to pulmonary hypertension which causes an increase in right ventricular pressure. This pressure then dilates the tricuspid valve, allowing blood to go backward. Another well-known cause of regurgitation is rheumatic heart disease, an autoimmune reaction that involves the valve leaflets and causes inflammation. This chronic inflammation leads to leaflet fibrosis, which makes it so that they don’t form a nice seal and instead let blood leak through. Still another cause of tricuspid regurgitation is damage to the papillary muscles from a heart attack. If these papillary muscles die, they can’t anchor the chordae tendineae, which then allows the tricuspid valve to flop back and allows blood to flow backward from the right ventricle into the right atrium. There are also congenital causes for this condition, like Ebstein’s anomaly, which is when a person is born with leaflets that are located too low, i.e., in the ventricle rather than between the atria and the ventricle, and this makes it hard for the leaflets to form a nice seal.In all of these situations, blood flows back into the right atrium during systole. This movement of blood can be heard as a holosystolic murmur, because it’s possible to hear blood flowing through the valve for the duration of systole. Another possible effect is Carvallo’s sign, which is when the murmur gets louder with inspiration, or inhalation. This happens because the negative pressure in the chest brings more blood back up into the heart, and more blood makes the murmur even noisier. Now, that extra blood that flowed backward into the atrium during systole ends up draining right back into the ventricle during diastole. This mean’s there’s an increase in right ventricular preload. It’s kind of like if you were digging a hole and every time you shoveled some dirt out, half of it fell back in; that’s a lot of wasted work.Eventually, to deal with this extra blood and the extra work required to pump it out, the right ventricle grows larger, a process called eccentric ventricular hypertrophy. In this situation, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones. This remodeling, or structural change, in the heart stretches the annulus, or ring of the valve, letting more blood leak back into the atrium and actually therefore worsening the regurgitation.This compensation works for a while, but eventually the right ventricle might not be able to keep up with the backflow of blood. This can lead to right-sided heart failure, which causes symptoms like distended neck veins,  swelling of the ankles and feet, and blood backed up to the liver, which causes hepatosplenomegaly, or swelling of the liver and spleen. Diagnosis is usually done with an echocardiogram, and treatment for tricuspid regurgitation is usually aimed at maintaining good fluid balance. Only rarely is valve repair or replacement needed.Let’s switch gears to tricuspid valve stenosis, where the tricuspid valve doesn’t open all the way during diastole, or filling. This is most often caused by rheumatic fever, and if the tricuspid valve is affected, then the mitral and aortic valve are almost always affected as well. In this case, as a result of inflammation, the leaflets can fuse together, and this is called commissural fusion. When this happens, the normal tricuspid valve opening narrows, making it a lot harder for blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. When the blood finally pushes open the fibrotic valve, this makes a distinctive “snap” sound, which is followed by a diastolic rumble as blood is forced through the smaller opening. Since it’s harder for blood to get through the valve, blood volume and pressure increase in the right atrium, This increased right atrial volume and pressure causes the atrium  to dilate, which can result in blood getting backed up into the veins. In addition, when the right atrium dilates, the muscle walls stretch and the pacemaker cells that run through these walls become more irritable, which increases the risk of arrhythmias like atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Just like regurgitation, tricuspid valve stenosis can lead to right-sided heart failure. Again, this leads to symptoms like distended neck veins, swelling of the ankles and feet, and blood backing up into the liver, causing hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is usually done with an echocardiogram, and treatment of tricuspid valve stenosis usually involves a balloon valvuloplasty, which means that a balloon is inserted and then inflated to open the narrowed valve and allow more blood to flow through it.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: tricuspid valve regurgitation is most often due to pulmonary hypertension and is also associated with rheumatic heart disease. On auscultation, you can hear a holosystolic murmur. Regurgitation can usually be treated with fluid balance, and, over time, it can lead to right-sided heart failure. Tricuspid valve stenosis is associated with rheumatic heart disease as well, and it typically also involves the mitral and aortic valves. On auscultation, you can hear a “snap” sound, followed by a diastolic rumble, and this can be treated with balloon valvuloplasty. Again, tricuspid stenosis can lead to right-sided heart failure.

              "  50: [\"The pulmonary valve is typically made up of three leaflets, the anterior, the left, and the right, and it opens during systole to allow blood to be ejected to the lungs. During diastole, it closes to allow the heart to fill with blood and get ready for another systole. If the pulmonary valve doesn’t open all the way, it makes it harder for the heart to pump blood out to the lungs, and this is called pulmonary stenosis. If the pulmonary valve doesn’t close all the way, then blood leaks back into the right ventricle, and this is called pulmonary valve regurgitation or pulmonary insufficiency.Pulmonary valve stenosis is often congenital, meaning that at birth, the leaflets are irregularly shaped or not fully developed. Pulmonic valve stenosis is often associated with congenital heart conditions like Tetralogy of Fallot, which affects all four chamber of the heart, as well as a genetic condition called Noonan's syndrome. In other cases, pulmonary valve stenosis can be caused by mechanical stress over time, which damages endothelial cells around the valves. This damage causes fibrosis and calcification, which harden the valve and make it more difficult for the valve to open all the way. Because pulmonary valve stenosis makes it harder for the valve to open when the right ventricle tries to eject blood, the valve resists for a second before finally snapping open, and this causes a characteristic “ejection click.” Because the blood has to flow through a narrow opening, we get increased turbulence, which creates a noise called a murmur. This murmur gets louder as more blood flows past the opening, and then it gets quieter as the amount of blood flowing through the valve decreases because There’s less in the ventricle. This sound is described as a crescendo-decrescendo murmur. Since it’s more difficult to open this hardened valve and push blood past it, the right ventricle has to generate really high pressures. To achieve those pressures it thickens its muscles, and this is called concentric right ventricular hypertrophy. This happens because new sarcomeres are added in parallel to the existing ones. However, even though you have this bulked up ventricle, the heart still might struggle to get enough blood through the narrowed opening and the lungs. Ultimately, that means that blood gets backed up, and so the person can develop right-sided heart failure. A final, different complication of pulmonic valve stenosis is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and it’s the damage caused to red blood cells as they’re forced through the smaller valve. This splits them into smaller fragments called schistocytes, which leads them to get peed out and to hemoglobinuria, or hemoglobin in the urine. When the blood is backed up into the body, this can lead to distended neck veins, swelling of the ankles and feet, and hepatosplenomegaly, which is an enlarged liver and spleen. Because less blood is able to get into the lungs, it can also cause symptoms like cyanosis, which is blue or purple discoloration of the skin, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue, which are most noticeable when the body’s demand for oxygen is high, like during exercise. Diagnosis is usually done with an echocardiogram, and treatment of pulmonic valve stenosis usually involves a balloon valvuloplasty, which means that a balloon is inserted and then inflated to open the narrowed valve and allow more blood flow through it. With pulmonary regurgitation, the valve doesn’t close all the way during diastole, or ventricular filling, so blood ends up flowing back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle. Regurgitation can happen due to valvular damage, which could caused by something like infective endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart. Another cause of pulmonary regurgitation is rheumatic heart disease, where chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis. Here, instead of fusing the valve leaflets together, the fibrosis prevents the leaves from forming a nice seal, and instead they let blood leak through. Sometimes, pulmonic regurgitation can be caused by previous heart surgeries: a balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for pulmonary stenosis could have opened the valve too far, or the person might have a malfunctioning prosthetic valve. In pulmonary regurgitation, the blood leaking back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle causes a diastolic decrescendo murmur. It’s considered a decrescendo murmur because it starts out loudest and then becomes more quiet over time. The backflow of blood increases the right ventricular blood volume and the amount of work that the right ventricle has to do during systole. This means that, over time, the right ventricle grows larger, and here we call this process eccentric ventricular hypertrophy. In this situation, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones. This compensation works for a little while, but eventually the right ventricle might not be able to keep up, which can lead to right-sided heart failure. Initially, pulmonary valve regurgitation might cause no symptoms at all. Over time, though, it can lead to right-sided heart failure, which can cause the blood to back up and symptoms like distended neck veins, swelling of the ankles and feet, and hepatosplenomegaly. Like with pulmonary valve stenosis, diagnosis is usually done with echocardiogram. Treatment for pulmonary regurgitation is usually valve replacement if right-sided heart failure develops. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap:  pulmonary valve stenosis is associated with congenital heart conditions like Tetralogy of Fallot; it results in the pulmonary valve not opening fully, and it causes a crescendo-decrescendo murmur. Over time, it can lead to right-sided heart failure and signs of cyanosis, but can be treated with balloon valvuloplasty. Pulmonary valve regurgitation is associated with things like infection and surgeries; it results in blood flowing backwards into the right ventricle, and it can cause a diastolic-decrescendo murmur. It’s usually asymptomatic, but over time it can lead to right-sided heart failure, and can be treated with valve replacement. \"],\n",
              "  51: ['The mitral valve has two leaflets: the anterior leaflet and the posterior leaflet. Together, they separate the left atrium from the left ventricle. During systole the valve closes, which means blood cannot do anything but be ejected out of the aortic valve and into circulation.   If the mitral valve doesn’t completely shut, blood can leak back into the left atrium; this is called mitral valve regurgitation. During diastole, the mitral valve opens and lets blood fill into the ventricle. If the mitral valve doesn’t open enough, it gets harder to fill the left ventricle; this is called mitral valve stenosis.  Let’s start with mitral valve regurgitation. The leading cause of mitral valve regurgitation, and the most common of all valvular conditions, is mitral valve prolapse. When the left ventricle contracts during systole, a ton of pressure is generated so that the blood can be pumped out of the aortic valve; therefore, a lot of pressure pushes on that closed mitral valve. Normally, the papillary muscles and connective tissue, called chordae tendineae or heart strings, keep the valve from prolapsing, or falling back into the atrium.   With mitral valve prolapse, the connective tissue of the leaflets and surrounding tissue are weakened; this is called myxomatous degeneration. Why this happens isn’t well understood, but it is sometimes associated with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Myxomatous degeneration results in a larger valve leaflet area and elongation of the chordae tendineae, which can sometimes rupture; this rupture typically happens to the chordae tendineae on the posterior leaflet, and can cause the posterior leaflet to fold up into the left atrium.Patients with a mitral valve prolapse are usually asymptomatic, but often have a classic heart murmur that includes a mid-systolic click, which is sometimes followed by a systolic murmur.   The click is a result of the leaflet folding into the atrium and being suddenly stopped by the chordae tendineae. Although mitral valve prolapse doesn’t always cause mitral regurgitation, it often does. If the leaflets don’t make a perfect seal, a little bit of blood leaks backward from the left ventricle into the left atrium, causing a murmur.  The mitral valve prolapse murmur is somewhat unique in that when patients squat down, the click comes later and the murmur is shorter, but when they stand or do a valsalva maneuver, the click comes sooner and the murmur lasts longer.   This happens because squatting increases venous return, which fills the left ventricle with slightly more blood; this means that the left ventricle gets just a little bit larger. Therefore, the larger leaflets have more space to hang out, and as the ventricle contracts and gets smaller, it takes just a little longer for the leaflet to get forced into the atrium. Standing, on the other hand, reduces venous return, meaning there’s a little less blood  in the ventricle and, by extension, a little less room to hang out; thus, the leaflet gets forced out earlier during contraction. The other heart murmur that follows this pattern is the one present in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  So, in addition to mitral valve prolapse, another cause of mitral regurgitation is damage to the papillary muscles from a heart attack. If these papillary muscles die, they can’t anchor the chordae tendineae, which then cause the mitral valve to flop back and allow blood to go from the left ventricle to the left atrium.  Left-sided heart failure that leads to ventricular dilation can also lead to mitral regurgitation, because as the left ventricle dilates, it stretches the mitral valve annulus, or ring, open and lets blood leak into the left atrium.   Mitral regurgitation can also be caused by rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease that can affect the heart tissue and lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease. The chronic inflammation from rheumatic fever leads to leaflet fibrosis, which prevents the leaflets from forming a nice seal, and instead they let blood leak through. Patients with mitral valve regurgitation typically have a holosystolic murmur, meaning it lasts for the duration of systole.   Now, even though we said that left-sided heart failure can cause mitral regurgitation, it also goes the other way; mitral regurgitation can be a cause of left-sided heart failure. With mitral regurgitation, every time the left ventricle contracts, some blood is inadvertently pumped out into the left atrium, which leads to increased preload as that blood is again drained back into the left ventricle after contraction. It’s kind of like if you were digging a hole and every time you shoveled some dirt out, half of it would fall back in. That’s a lot of wasted work, right?  When this happens, both the left atrium and ventricle experience volume overload. To better manage this larger volume, the left side of the heart undergoes eccentric hypertrophy; here, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones, and it grows larger. This compensation works for awhile, but eventually the left ventricle might not be able to keep up, and it can lead to left-sided heart failure.  All right, let’s switch gears to mitral valve stenosis, which is most often caused by rheumatic fever. In this case, instead of the inflammation causing the leaflets not to form a good enough seal, the leaflets can fuse together; this is called commissural fusion. When this happens, the normal mitral valve opening, which is about 4 to 6 cm2, can narrow down to 2cm2. This makes it a lot harder for blood to flow from the left atrium to left ventricle, so the volume of blood in the left atrium increases, leading to higher pressures in the left atrium. Higher pressures flowing through a fibrotic valve make a “snap” sound when the valve opens, which is followed by a diastolic rumble as the blood is forced through the smaller opening.  A constant elevation in both blood volume and pressure in the left atrium causes it to dilate, and can allow blood to back up into the pulmonary circulation; this causes pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema, which can lead to symptoms like dyspnea, or difficulty breathing. All this extra blood volume causes higher pressures in the pulmonary circulation, or pulmonary hypertension, which can ultimately make it harder for the right ventricle to pump blood to the lungs. Therefore, over time the right ventricle can hypertrophy and ultimately fail, which is called right-sided heart failure.  Additionally, when the left atrium dilates, the muscle walls stretch and the pacemaker cells that run through the walls become more irritable, which increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. During atrial fibrillation, the right and left atrium don’t contract properly anymore, causing more blood to stagnate. Since the left atrium is already pretty dilated, static pools of blood can become a major risk for thrombus formation, and if a blood clot forms, it can immediately get into the systemic circulation. Finally, let’s think about the heart in relation to other structures in the chest. If the atrium dilates and gets really large, it can compress its neighbor, the esophagus, and patients might have difficulty swallowing solid foods, which is called dysphagia. For patients with severe problems related to mitral regurgitation or stenosis, treatment involves valve repair or surgical replacement of the valve.###SUMMARYAll right, time for a quick recap… Mitral valve diseases include mitral valve regurgitation which is due to incomplete closure of the valve; and mitral valve stenosis, which is narrowing of the valve. Mitral regurgitation causes blood to leak back into the left atrium, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and left-sided heart failure. Whereas, mitral stenosis causes obstruction of blood flow to the left ventricle, leading to pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Treatment for mitral regurgitation or stenosis involves valve repair or surgical replacement of the valve.'],\n",
              "  52: ['The aortic valve is typically made up of three leaflets: the left, the right, and the posterior leaflet. The aortic valve opens during systole to allow blood to be ejected to the body. During diastole, it closes to allow the heart to fill with blood and get ready for another systole. If the aortic valve doesn’t open all the way, it gets harder to pump blood out to the body; this is called aortic stenosis. If it doesn’t close all the way, then blood leaks back into the left ventricle; this is called aortic valve regurgitation or aortic insufficiency.Usually, the aortic valve opens to about 3-4 cm2, but with stenosis it can become less than 1 cm2. This is usually caused by mechanical stress over time, which damages endothelial cells around the valves, causing fibrosis and calcification, which hardens the valve and makes it more difficult to open completely. This type usually shows up in late adulthood, typically in patients over 60 years old.   Similarly, patients that have a bicuspid valve — with two leaflets — as opposed to a tricuspid — with three leaflets — are more at risk of fibrosis and calcification because the mechanical stress that’s usually distributed between three leaflets is now split by only two leaflets. Therefore, there is more stress per leaflet. Another important cause of aortic stenosis is chronic rheumatic fever, which can cause repeated inflammation and repair, leading to fibrosis. In this case, the leaflets can actually fuse together — called commissural fusion — which can be an important distinction from the type caused by mechanical stress over time.  When the valve fuses together or hardens, it doesn’t open as easily, right? And so as the left ventricle contracts, it creates this high pressure that eventually pushes on the valve until it finally snaps open, causing a characteristic “ejection click.” Since the blood has to flow through a narrow opening, there’s turbulence which creates noise, or a murmur, which gets initially gets louder as more blood flows past the opening, and then becomes quieter as the amount of blood flowing subsides because less remains in the ventricle. This is called a crescendo-decrescendo murmur.   Since now it’s harder to open and push blood past this hardened valve, the left ventricle has to generate higher pressure each time it contracts to get the same amount of blood through. To accomplish this, the left ventricle can thicken its muscles, called concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. This happens because new sarcomeres are added in parallel to the existing ones.   Even though you have this bulked-up ventricle, the heart still might struggle to get enough blood through the narrowed opening and the body, and ultimately to the vital organs. This means that the person’s at risk of developing heart failure, and various symptoms related to whichever organ is involved. For example, if there’s a reduction in blood flow to the brain, it could lead to syncope. A reduction in blood flow through coronary arteries to the heart’s own myocardium could cause chest pain and angina. Patients might not initially experience symptoms at rest, but only during exercise, because exercise requires more blood, right? And the heart isn’t able to increase blood flow through this small opening. A final complication is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is essentially damage to red blood cells as they’re forced through the smaller valve, splitting them into smaller fragments called schistocytes. This leads to hemoglobinuria, which is hemoglobin in the urine. Treatment is usually replacement of the valve, which often doesn’t happen until after the onset of symptoms.  All right, so that was aortic stenosis. What about aortic regurgitation? Well, normally right after the ventricle pumps blood out through the aortic valve, the valve shuts and remains shut until the ventricle fills again. With aortic regurgitation, sometimes called aortic insufficiency, blood flows back from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, or during ventricular filling. About half of cases are caused by aortic root dilation. This is when the root dilates, or gets bigger, and in doing so pulls apart the leaflets, making it harder for the valves to fit snugly together and close all the way, letting some blood flow backward. The vast majority — about 80% — of aortic root dilations are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown. The remaining 20% are causes like aortic dissection, aneurysms, and syphilis, all of which can ultimately lead to widening the aortic root. Besides root dilation, regurgitation may happen due to valvular damage, such as from something like infective endocarditis—a bacterial infection of the inner lining of the heart—or again, from chronic rheumatic fever. In this situation, the chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis, but instead of fusing the valve leaflets together, it makes it so that they don’t form a strong seal, and instead let blood leak through. Patients with aortic regurgitation will have an early decrescendo diastolic murmur, caused by the blood flowing back through the valve.  Because blood is leaking back from the aorta into the left ventricle, the left ventricular blood volume increases, which increases the stroke volume, or the amount of blood that the left ventricle pumps out during contraction, or systole. More blood pumped out of the heart per squeeze requires more pressure, so systolic blood pressure increases. During diastole, though, there’s less blood volume in the aorta because some has leaked back into the ventricle, which means that diastolic blood pressure decreases.   A higher systolic pressure and lower diastolic pressure means an increase in pulse pressure, which is just systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure. A large pulse pressure, meaning a large difference between systolic and diastolic pressure, is referred to as a hyperdynamic circulation. Patients with a hyperdynamic circulation have bounding pulses, or water-hammer pulses, because the blood — which is mostly composed of water — slams like a hammer against the walls of the arteries with each heartbeat. These bounding pulses can be dramatic enough that they cause head bobbing that’s in tune with the heartbeat, and can cause the capillary beds in the fingernails to pulsate, sometimes called Quincke’s sign.  Over time, the increase in blood volume in the left ventricle causes the chamber to grow larger; this is called eccentric ventricular hypertrophy. In this situation, new sarcomeres are added in series to existing ones. Just like aortic stenosis, treatment for aortic regurgitation is replacement of the valve after symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction develop.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap…. Aortic stenosis happens if the aortic valve doesn’t open all the way, and aortic valve regurgitation happens if the valve doesn’t close all the way. Both can cause murmurs and hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Stenosis can also lead to heart failure and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, while regurgitation can also cause hyperdynamic circulation. Treatment for both is replacement of the valve after symptoms have developed.'],\n",
              "  53: ['Cardiomyopathy translates to “heart muscle disease,” so cardiomyopathy is a broad term used to describe a variety of issues that result from disease of the myocardium, or heart muscle. When cardiomyopathy develops as a way to compensate for some other underlying disease, such as hypertension or valve diseases, it’s called secondary cardiomyopathy. When it develops all by itself, it’s called primary cardiomyopathy.Now, the most common type is dilated cardiomyopathy, which can cause all four chambers of the heart to dilate, or get bigger. Specifically, new sarcomeres, or muscle units, in the walls are added in series, and the chambers grow larger, which leaves the walls relatively thin compared to the large chamber size, with less muscle to use for contraction.In other words, they have really weak contractions, which means less blood is pumped out each contraction. This also means that there’s a lower stroke volume, and if the heart’s failing to pump out as much blood to both the body from the left ventricle, and the lungs from the right ventricle, patients develop biventricular congestive heart failure. Since contraction happens during systole, we say this is a type of systolic heart failure.  Also, when the chambers get larger, they tend to stretch out the valves that separate the atria and ventricles. When they are stretched, the valves can’t close all the way, so they start to regurgitate blood back into the atria. This is called mitral valve regurgitation on the left side, and tricuspid valve regurgitation on the right. Mitral valve regurgitation might be heard on auscultation as a holosystolic murmur, meaning that it happens throughout systole.Additionally, you might also hear an S3 heart sound on auscultation, which is the result of blood rushing and slamming into the dilated ventricular wall during diastole.Another complication can be arrhythmias, because stretching out the muscle walls can irritate the cells in the conduction system, which are within those walls. Sometimes, an X-ray can be helpful for a diagnosing dilated cardiomyopathy.As far as causes go, primary dilated cardiomyopathy is most often idiopathic, meaning there isn’t a clearly identifiable cause. Some cases, however, can be traced back to specific genetic mutations or genetic conditions, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and hemochromatosis. Also, in some cases it can be caused by an infection, like coxsackievirus B, which causes myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — or Chagas disease, a protozoal infection. Also, alcohol abuse is strongly linked to dilated cardiomyopathy because alcohol and its metabolites have a direct toxic effect on the myocardium.  Similarly, certain drugs, including chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, but also drugs like cocaine, can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Also, wet beriberi, having too little Vitamin B1, or thiamine, can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is an important cause as well, because dilated cardiomyopathy can develop in the third trimester of pregnancy or in the weeks following delivery, probably due to issues like pregnancy-associated hypertension. However, about half of patients recover following pregnancy. As you can see, there are a lot of things that can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Regardless of the cause, the outcome is less effective systolic function. Treatment for severe dilated cardiomyopathy can include a left ventricular assist device, or an LVAD, which is a mechanical pump that assists the heart in distributing blood. In extreme cases, someone might have a heart transplant.### SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Dilated cardiomyopathy is a disease of the myocardium which causes all four chambers of the heart to get bigger. Because heart walls will be thin compared to the large chambers, this can result in weak contraction, low stroke volume, and congestive heart failure. It can also cause valve regurgitation and arrhythmias. Treatment, in extreme cases, is to do a heart transplant.'],\n",
              "  54: [\"Cardiomyopathy means “heart muscle disease,” so cardiomyopathy is a broad term used to describe a variety of issues that result from disease of the myocardium, or heart muscle. When cardiomyopathy develops as a way to compensate for some other underlying disease, like hypertension or valve diseases, it’s called secondary cardiomyopathy; when it develops all by itself, it’s called primary cardiomyopathy.Now, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is when the walls get thick, heavy, and hypercontractile; essentially, the muscles grow a lot larger because new sarcomeres are being added parallel to existing ones. Usually, the left ventricle is affected, and in most cases, this muscle growth is asymmetrical, meaning that the interventricular septum grows larger relative to the free wall. These larger muscles do two things: the walls take up more room, so less blood is able to fill the ventricle; and they become more stiff and less compliant, so they can’t stretch out as much, again, leading to less filling. When the ventricles don’t fill as much, they don’t pump out as much blood, and so stroke volume goes down. Thus, the heart can fail to pump enough blood to the body; this is called heart failure. Because this is due to a dysfunction in filling, which happens during diastole, this is a type of diastolic heart failure. In some patients, the muscle growth of the interventricular septum essentially gets in the way of the left ventricular outflow tract during systole, or ventricular contraction. This increases blood velocity through the smaller opening, and pulls the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve toward the septum. This is called the venturi effect, which further obstructs the left ventricular outflow tract. For this reason, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is sometimes called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. An obstructed left ventricular outflow tract means blood is forced through a tiny opening, which tends to cause a crescendo-decrescendo murmur. A crescendo-decrescendo murmur gets louder as blood first rushes out, and then softer; this is very similar to the murmur in aortic valve stenosis.However, the intensity of the murmur caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can change depending on how much the outflow tract is obstructed. If the person squats down or does a handgrip maneuver, systemic vascular resistance increases, which makes it harder to eject blood out and increases afterload. This means that the ventricle has more blood stretching it out, so it becomes less obstructed, and the murmur becomes less intense.  If the person stands upright or does a valsalva maneuver, however, venous return decreases. This decreases preload, meaning less blood is stretching out the ventricle before ejection, and the obstruction gets larger; thus the murmur’s intensity increases. Also, people with obstructive Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might have a bifid pulse. Here, two pulses are felt because the mitral valve is moving toward the outflow tract and causing increased obstruction mid-systole. So, with larger muscle mass, the ventricles become less compliant. Remember, this means that they don’t stretch as easily when filled with blood. If you’re listening on auscultation, often an S4 sound can be heard from the atria contracting and pushing blood into a non-compliant ventricular wall during diastole. Another thing to know is that those larger muscles need a lot of oxygen. We just talked about how the heart has a harder time getting blood, and therefore oxygen, to the tissues, right? Well, without oxygen they can become ischemic; this is thought to be the reason why people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes develop dangerously fast arrhythmias, and why hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden death in young individuals, and especially young athletes. A bit less severe symptoms of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might include dyspnea, which is difficulty breathing, or syncope, which is fainting. Now, the majority of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by a genetic missense mutation, which happens when a single nucleotide is swapped, causing a different amino acid to be coded. This type of mutation usually happens in one of the genes that encode proteins in the sarcomere of heart muscle. The beta-myosin heavy chain is the most common, but it could also be mutations in the myosin binding protein C and Troponin T. A classic finding on histology is myocyte disarray, where instead of making nice parallel lines, myofibers don’t line up. Also, people with Friedreich's Ataxia, which is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, often develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might involve medications, such as beta blockers, which help slow down the heart rate. If the patient doesn’t tolerate those well, calcium channel blockers, like verapamil or diltiazem, might be used. However, digoxin, a medication used occasionally for heart conditions, is contraindicated because it tends to increase force of contraction, which can actually increase the obstruction as blood is forced out of the ventricle. Besides pharmacological treatments, some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might have surgery.### SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap.... Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is when the walls of the heart get thick, heavy, and hypercontractile. It usually affects the left ventricle, causing symptoms like a lower stroke volume, an obstructed left ventricular outflow tract during systole, a variable crescendo-decrescendo murmur, a bifid pulse, and dangerously fast arrhythmias. It is most commonly caused by a genetic mutation affecting proteins in the sarcomere of heart muscle.\"],\n",
              "  55: ['Endocarditis means “inflammation of the inner layer of the heart.” The heart’s wall is made up of three layers: the epicardium, the outermost layer; the myocardium; and then the endocardium, which is the layer that gets inflamed.  It turns out that most cases of endocarditis are due to a microbial infection of the endocardium, usually involving the endocardium lining the cardiac valves. Why the valves? Well, it turns out that the valves have tiny blood vessels that nourish them, even though they’re flopping around in blood all day long. This means that an infection can potentially result from a damaged valve, because it would allow microbes to escape the tiny blood vessels and invade the valve tissue, or on the flip side, microbes in the blood might enter the tiny vessels within the valve.   Either way, a microbe has to first get into the bloodstream, and that might happen if a person: has an open wound or an abscess; a dental or surgical procedure; or, an injection with an infected needle or infected substance, from using illegal drugs.   Most often, the valves on the left side — the mitral valve and the aortic valve — are affected, sometimes due to predisposing conditions, such as mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valves, but it really depends on the circumstances. Risk factors for either valve include having prosthetic valves, congenital cardiac defect involving the valves, damage to the valves from rheumatic heart disease, and intravenous drug use, which typically affects the tricuspid valve.  Now, the first step that happens in endocarditis is that the endothelial lining of the valve gets damaged. There are a number of ways this can happen, such as previous inflammation or injury. This damage exposes the underlying collagen and tissue factor, causing platelets and fibrin to adhere, which forms this tiny thrombosis or blood clot. This is called Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis, or NBTE. It’s nonbacterial because it happens even before the bacteria shows up. Now, if you add in bacteriemia, or bacteria in the blood, you’ve got yourself a recipe for infective endocarditis.   Every day, there are opportunities for microbes to get into the bloodstream, whether it’s through brushing your teeth and having them slip into the gums, or having them slip in through your gut or lungs. Whatever the case, they regularly make their way into the body. It’s not usually not a problem though, because it’s a small amount and can easily be killed by your immune system. However, occasionally they float around in the blood for long enough to find an NBTE, which serves as a perfect location for them to attach and set up an infection, called a vegetation. To attach to an NBTE, a lot of bacterial species use proteins on their surface, called adhesins, that let them stick to the valve and stick to one another. They also create an extracellular matrix around themselves, called biofilm, which allows them to literally stick together and form a large clump of bacteria that can behave like a colony.  Usually, these guys stick to areas of lower pressures, since it’s easier to adhere. So, let’s take mitral valve regurgitation, where blood flows backward from the higher pressure left ventricle to the lower pressure left atrium. In this case, vegetations will tend to form on the lower pressure atrial surface. Not only will they form here, they’ll also form on the edge of the opening, due to the venturi effect. The venturi effect describes how fluid pressure decreases as it flows through a narrowed opening, while its velocity increases. So, as blood forces its way through the opening, pressure is lower near the edges.   If the person has aortic regurgitation, meaning that blood is going from the higher pressure aorta to the lower pressure ventricle, then vegetations tend to be located on the lower pressure ventricular surface of the valve.  Infective endocarditis used to be classified into acute and subacute groups, based on how quickly the infection developed, but nowadays the key is to identify the microbial cause of infection and treat it as effectively as possible.Viridans Streptococci is the most common cause. Its virulence is low, it’s found in the mouth, and it usually attacks valves that have had some previous damage that resulted in small vegetations that didn’t destroy the valve.Staphylococcus aureus, on the other hand, is a highly virulent bacteria that can be found on the skin.This guy can infect both damaged and healthy valves, and particularly, the tricuspid valve. S aureus causes large vegetations that can destroy the valve. This bacteria is most commonly contracted from intravenous drug use.Next, we have Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a bacteria that loves foreign prosthetic material, like prosthetic heart valves. One way that the bacteria gets into the body is at the time of heart valve surgery, when it literally sticks around on the valve. Another common point of entry into the body is through an infected intravenous catheter. Both of these scenarios usually happen in a hospital, so either would be considered a nosocomial infection.Two other bacterial species are Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus bovis, which are both normally found in the gut flora. However, when somebody has severe colorectal disease, like colorectal cancer or ulcerative colitis, these gut bacteria can migrate across the gut lining and into the bloodstream, which is a setup for potential endocarditis. An even more unusual bacteria is Coxiella burnetii, which patients typically contract after exposure to infected animals, such as cows, sheep, and goats. The bacteria initially causes a disease called “Q fever.” Months, or sometimes years, after the initial Q fever, patients can develop endocarditis, but usually this is in high-risk people: patients who are immunocompromised; pregnant women; and those with pre-existing heart valve defect, which makes it tricky to diagnose unless there’s a reason to suspect it.  Finally, a group of organisms that are less commonly associated with endocarditis are the HACEK organisms. These guys are a group of gram-negative bacteria that are also part of the normal flora of the mouth and throat. Each letter of HACEK stands for a different genus: Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella.  Now, people with infective endocarditis almost always have a fever, and a new heart murmur that results from turbulent blood flow past a damaged heart valve. Sometimes, the vegetations can detach from the valve, and little clumps of pathogens, called septic emboli, can float through the bloodstream.  These guys can lodge under the fingernails, causing splinter hemorrhages, or in the palms and soles of the feet, causing small painless, flat, and erythematous lesions, called Janeway lesions. In contrast, there might be an immune reaction with antigen-antibody complexes that form and deposit in different parts of the body. In the fingers and toes, these complexes can lead to painful lesions called Osler’s nodes. In the eye, these deposits can lead to Roth spots. In the kidney, they can lead to glomerulonephritis.   Diagnosing the cause of infective endocarditis typically involves getting positive blood culture, which means growing bacteria from a blood sample. Echocardiography can also be used to visualize the heart and look for vegetations or more subtle clues, like the way the valve’s moving. Depending on the organism that caused the infection, a prolonged course of antibiotics will likely be used to try and wipe out the infection, but surgery might be needed for severe cases, especially when the valve dysfunction causes heart failure. It’s also important to prevent endocarditis, especially among high risk groups, such as people with prosthetic heart valves or a history of endocarditis. Before dental procedures, sometimes these people are recommended antibiotics; remember, some of those microbes that cause endocarditis live in the mouth.Finally, there’s Libman-Sacks endocarditis, which is not infection-related. This one’s usually associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, which is an autoimmune disease involving antigen-antibody complexes. In this case, they settle in the endocardium and cause inflammation. These areas of inflammation can happen anywhere on the valve surface or chordae tendineae, but typically happen on the mitral valve, which leads to mitral valve regurgitation. In this case, inflammation can also happen on the atrial endocardium or ventricular endocardium.###SUMMARYAll right, so to recap: endocarditis, or inflammation of the endocardium, typically develops from bacterial infection. In this case, there’s usually first some damage or injury to the heart valves that leads to thrombi, which serve as places for bacteria to adhere and cause inflammation. Sometimes, however, it can be nonbacterial, such as in the case of libman-sacks endocarditis, which is associated with Lupus, an autoimmune disease.'],\n",
              "  56: ['With myocarditis, myo- means muscle, card- means heart, and -itis means inflammation. So, myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium, which is the muscular middle layer of the heart wall, which contracts and relaxes so the heart can pump blood all around the body.Inflammation in the myocardium layer causes swelling, which damages the heart muscle cells’ ability to contract. That means that less blood gets pumped out of the heart with each heartbeat. If myocarditis is severe enough, it can lead to heart failure, which is when the heart can’t keep up with the demands of the body. Once the inflammation resolves, the heart contraction typically returns to normal, but occasionally, when the inflammation is really severe, it can cause fibrosis, or scar tissue, in the myocardium. Scar tissue doesn’t contract normally, so if that happens, it can cause long term problems with heart contraction.In North America, viral infections, specifically Coxsackievirus B infections, are the main cause of myocarditis. Viral infections can trigger lymphocytic myocarditis, which is when lymphocytes - the B and T cells of the immune system - and water make their way into the  interstitial space - the space in between heart muscle cells. There are plenty of other infectious causes as well, though. One of these is trypanosoma cruzi, a single-cell protozoan that causes Chagas disease throughout South America. In Chagas disease, under a microscope, it’s possible to see groups of amastigotes within the heart muscle cells, which are trypanosomes that are in the intracellular stage. As a result, the heart muscle cells necrose or die. There’s  also Trichinella, a roundworm that moves from the intestines into various parts of the body, causing a variety of problems, including myocarditis. Myocarditis can also be seen in Lyme disease which is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is spread by deer ticks. Finally, in immunocompromised individuals, there’s Toxoplasma gondii, a single-cell parasite harbored by cats, that can cause myocarditis. Those were the infectious causes, but there are also non-infectious causes of myocarditis as well. These include systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus, and polymyositis, a generalized inflammation of the muscles, where the immune system starts to attack the myocardial layer of the heart. There’s also drug-associated myocarditis, which means there’s an adverse drug reaction that inflames the heart. Drug reactions cause a hypersensitivity myocarditis, which is when eosinophils get into the blood vessels in the myocardium.  Finally, there’s giant cell myocarditis, which causes inflammation in the heart, from an unknown cause. The key finding is that macrophages - immune cells that engulf foreign substances - start to fuse together to form a single giant cell, hence the name. Individuals with myocarditis can have chest pain that is sometimes positional, meaning that it can get better or worse depending on the body’s position. It can also cause arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, because the inflammation affects the pacemaker cells traveling through the myocardium. There can also be more general symptoms like fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. In severe cases, where myocarditis starts to develop into heart failure, there can be additional symptoms like fluid retention in the feet and ankles. Individuals with myocarditis suffer heart muscle damage, which causes troponin and creatine kinase levels to rise on blood tests. An electrocardiogram can show sinus tachycardia, a fast heart rate, as well as T-wave inversions and “saddle-shaped” ST-segment elevations because it looks a bit like a horse saddle. In addition,a chest X-ray might show an enlarged heart, while echography might show inflamed heart muscle walls. Ultimately, the diagnosis is based on a biopsy of the cardiac muscle but doing that procedure comes with some risk so it’s not always done. The treatment of myocarditis depends on the underlying cause. Viral myocarditis usually improves slowly over time, and other infections are treated with appropriate antibiotics. If there are signs of heart failure, then they are typically managed with medication and careful fluid balance. Arrhythmias usually resolve as the inflammation improves as well. Finally, in severe cases, like some cases of Chagas myocarditis and giant cell myocarditis a heart transplant can be needed if other treatments don’t work. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap: in North America, myocarditis is most often caused by viruses like Coxsackie, but in South America a common cause is Chagas disease. Symptoms include positional chest pain and arrhythmias, and classic ECG findings include sinus tachycardia with “saddle shaped” ST segment elevation and T wave inversions. '],\n",
              "  57: ['With pericarditis, “peri” means “around,” card means “the heart”, and itis means “inflamed”. So pericarditis means the pericardial layer of tissue that covers the heart has inflammation. Acute pericarditis generally lasts just a few weeks, whereas chronic pericarditis lasts longer, usually more than 6 months. People who develop pericarditis are also at risk of also developing a pericardial effusion - that’s when the inflammation causes fluid to accumulate around the heart. The pericardium is a pouch or cavity that the heart sits inside of. The outer layer of this pouch is the fibrous pericardium and it helps keep the heart in place within the chest cavity. The inner layer of the pouch is the serous pericardium that includes the pericardial cavity, and is filled with a small amount of fluid that lets the heart slip around as it beats. The cells of the serous pericardium secrete and reabsorb the fluid, so usually there’s no more than 50 milliliters of fluid in the pericardial cavity at one time -  that’s about as much as a shot glass.Now, the cause of acute pericarditis is usually idiopathic, meaning that we don’t know what causes it. When the cause is identified, it’s usually a viral infection, like Coxsackie B virus. Another cause is Dressler syndrome which occurs several weeks after a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Basically, when heart cells die in a myocardial infarction, it leads to massive inflammation that also involves the serous pericardium. Another cause of pericarditis, called uremic pericarditis, is when blood levels of urea, a nitrogen waste product, get really high usually due to kidney problems. The high levels of urea irritate the serous pericardium, making it secrete a thick pericardial fluid that’s full of fibrin strands and white blood cells. This gives the wall of the serous pericardium a “buttered bread” appearance.Pericarditis can also be seen in autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or systemic lupus erythematosus, because the immune system attacks its own tissues, including the pericardium. Other causes of pericarditis include cancer, radiation therapy in the chest, and even medications like penicillin, and certain anticonvulsants.  Regardless of the cause, inflammation in the pericardium means that fluid as well as immune cells start moving from tiny blood vessels in the fibrous and serous pericardium into the tissue or interstitium of those layers, making the layer itself a bit thicker and more boggy - think of how a piece of dry flat pasta gets cooked and thickens up as it soaks up fluid. Now, a pericardial effusion can also develop. That’s when pericardial fluid begins to pool in the pericardial space, because the serous pericardium can’t remove it as quickly as it comes in. If a lot of fluid starts to collect in the pericardial space - in other words, if that pericardial effusion gets really big, then it can start putting pressure on the heart itself, preventing it from fully stretching out or relaxing between contractions. This can lead to tamponade physiology which is where the cardiac chambers can’t fill with blood properly, causing a decrease in  cardiac output - which can be a medical emergency. When the inflammation persists for weeks to months, the process is called chronic pericarditis. In chronic pericarditis, immune cells initiate fibrosis of the serous pericardium which can produce a inelastic shell around the heart making it hard for the ventricles to expand—it’s like the heart is being squeezed by a boa constrictor. Over time, it becomes harder for the heart to relax or expand, and the stroke volume - the amount of blood the heart squirts out with each heartbeat goes down, and to compensate the heart rate goes up. This is similar to tamponade physiology but happens more gradually and is a result of a change in the composition of the serous pericardium, rather than a fluid collection around the serous pericardium. The main symptom of pericarditis is fever and chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, but improves with sitting up and leaning forward. Larger pericardial effusions, those over 100ml of fluid, can cause diminished heart sounds, and can even diminish cardiac output leading to shortness of breath, low blood pressure, and lightheadedness.There are a few ways to diagnose pericarditis and pericardial effusions. First, when the thickened layers of the pericardium rub up against each other - it creates a friction rub which can be heard on auscultation. It sounds like two pieces of leather rubbing against each other. Next, on an electrocardiogram, there are a few changes that you can expect to see. In the first couple days to weeks, there can be ST segment elevations and PR segment depressions. After that, the T waves tend to flatten and then becomes inverted over a few weeks, and then eventually the ECG returns back to normal. On an ECG, pericardial effusions, especially large ones, can show low QRS complex voltage or electrical alternans, which is where the QRS complexes have different heights, as a result of the heart swinging back and forth in a pool of pericardial fluid. On an X-ray of a heart with a large pericardial effusion, you can see a silhouette that pools to the bottom of the heart and gives a classic “water bottle” sign. On an echocardiogram, a pericardial effusion makes the heart looks like it’s dancing within the pericardium, whereas chronic pericarditis shows the stiff serous pericardium restricting the heart’s movement.In terms of treatment, the main goal is to relieve pain with analgesic medication, and to treat the underlying cause of inflammation. If there’s a severe pericardial effusion, a pericardiocentesis can be done by inserting a needle into the pericardial cavity and draining the excess fluid. ###SUMMARYOkay, let’s recap - acute pericarditis is usually caused by a idiopathic causes, but can be caused by viruses or after a myocardial infarction. It usually results in a friction rub, as well as ECG changes like ST elevation and PR depression, followed by T wave flattening and inversion. Pericardial effusions typically lead to low QRS voltages or electrical alternans, and can be seen on an echocardiograph. Chronic pericarditis typically results from fibrin deposition in the serous pericardium and it prevents the heart from fully relaxing.'],\n",
              "  58: ['The name “cardiac tamponade” can be broken down: “tamponade” refers to pressure which obstructs blood flow, and “cardiac” refers to the heart. So in cardiac tamponade there’s a buildup of fluid in the pericardium, and that fluid puts pressure on the outside of the heart. As a result, the heart is unable to pump normally and blood flow is obstructed.  Normally, the heart sits inside a two-layered pouch or cavity called the pericardium. The outer layer is the fibrous pericardium, which helps keep the heart in place within the chest cavity. The inner layer of the pouch is the serous pericardium, which includes the pericardial cavity; it’s filled with a small amount of fluid that lets the heart slip around as it beats. The cells of the serous pericardium secrete and reabsorb the fluid, so usually there’s no more than 50 milliliters of fluid in the pericardial cavity at any time—that’s about as much as would fit into a shot glass.A pericardial effusion happens when this normally protective fluid begins to pool in the pericardial space. It can develop into cardiac tamponade depending on how much fluid there is and how quickly that fluid accumulates. A rapid accumulation of fluid can occur as a result of trauma to the chest. For example, a stab wound can puncture a blood vessel and fill the pericardium with blood. Even blunt trauma like a steering wheel getting pushed into your chest during a car crash can lead to tamponade, because the force of the impact causes the rupture of lots of small blood vessels. Cardiac tamponade can also happen a few days after a myocardial infarction, because the weak, infarcted ventricular wall ruptures when it’s exposed to the high ventricular pressures. It’s a bit like how jeans might tear at the spot where the denim is worn away and already quite weak. A rare cause is heart surgery, where, once again, a weakened muscle can rupture and cause cardiac tamponade days after the operation. Yet another cause is aortic dissection, which is when blood pools in the actual wall of the aorta. If the aortic dissection ruptures through the wall of the aorta and through the fibrous pericardium, blood can spill right into the pericardial cavity, leading to cardiac tamponade. In these situations, even a small volume—as little as 150 ml!—can lead to tamponade, because the pericardium doesn’t have time to stretch and accommodate it. Other causes of cardiac tamponade involve more long-term factors, rather than sudden trauma. In these cases, the fluid comes from a chronically inflamed serous pericardium that can’t resorb pericardial fluid as quickly as it builds up. Long-term causes of cardiac tamponade include cancers that have spread to the pericardium, often from the lung and the breast. Another cause is uremic pericarditis, where blood levels of urea, a nitrogen waste product, get really high, usually due to a kidney problem. The high levels of urea in the blood irritate the serous pericardium. More rarely, cardiac tamponade can happen due to hypothyroidism or because of chronic inflammation from a connective tissue disease. In these situations, when fluid accumulates gradually, the pericardium can hold as much as 1.5 L of fluid before tamponade sets in.So, in cases of cardiac tamponade, fluid puts pressure on the heart itself, preventing it from fully stretching out or relaxing between contractions. This means that the cardiac chambers can’t fill with blood properly, causing a decrease in cardiac output or a lower amount of blood being squeezed out with each heartbeat, which leads to hypotension. Less blood leaving the heart also means less blood reaching the organs and tissues, and the heart tries to compensate for its low output by beating faster. When a person suffering from cardiac tamponade breathes in, the systolic blood pressure sometimes drops. Normally, inspiration creates a tiny bit of negative pressure which pulls blood into the heart, momentarily increasing systemic venous return. When that happens, the right heart volumes increases, and the right ventricle expands a bit into the pericardial space, so it doesn’t affect the left heart volume at all. During inspiration in someone with cardiac tamponade, the right ventricle can’t move into the pericardial space, so the extra volume pushes the interventricular septum leftwards. This leads to a reduction in left ventricular diastolic volume, a lower stroke volume, and a drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. A decrease in the systolic pressure of greater than 10 mmHg is called pulsus paradoxus, and it’s a classic sign of cardiac tamponade.In tamponade, there’s also trouble in the upper heart chambers: the atria can’t distend enough to accommodate the venous blood returning to the heart. That blood will have nowhere to go but back into the veins. That’s why you’ll typically see distended jugular veins when you look at the neck of a person with cardiac tamponade. This sign is actually part of a triad of symptoms called Beck’s triad: distended neck veins, hypotension, and distant heart sounds on auscultation. Although not part of the triad, tachycardia and coughing can also develop. People with tamponade will experience dyspnea (labored breathing), as well as weakness and lightheadedness. If it gets severe enough, the heart can ultimately start getting ischemic and stop beating altogether. This dangerous situation requires immediate drainage of pericardial fluid.A diagnosis of cardiac tamponade often starts with an ECG reading. Classic findings include tachycardia, a low QRS complex voltage, and electrical alternans, which is when the QRS complexes have different heights. Echocardiography can show the excess pericardial fluid as well as the heart “swinging” around inside the pericardial cavity. Cardiac catheterization measures the pressure inside the cardiac chambers—in case of tamponade, the pressure in all four chambers is equal.Treatment of cardiac tamponade in the acute setting is a pericardiocentesis. That’s where a needle is inserted directly into the pericardium to drain the excess pericardial fluid. Following this, the underlying disease has to be monitored and managed. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… Cardiac tamponade is a collection of fluid inside the pericardium that puts pressure on the heart, affecting its function. People with cardiac tamponade frequently present with Beck’s triad: hypotension, distended neck veins, and distant heart sounds during auscultation. Treatment of cardiac tamponade requires an immediate pericardiocentesis, as well as treatment of the underlying condition.'],\n",
              "  59: ['Cardiac tumors are abnormal growths of cells that form a mass in the heart. If the cell growth has the potential to invade and spread to other tissues — a process called metastasis — it’s a malignant tumor, more commonly known as a cancer. If it is not able to invade other tissues, it’s referred to as a benign tumor.Now, the vast majority of tumors of the heart are actually secondary, meaning that a tumor developed somewhere  else in the body, metastasized, and spread to the heart.   Even though these secondary tumors can come from anywhere, they’re most commonly metastases from lung cancer, lymphoma or lymphatic system cancer, breast cancer, leukemia or blood cell cancer, melanoma or skin cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer, and colon cancer, in this order. Cancer most commonly metastasizes through the lymphatic system to the pericardium, the membrane around the heart. When the pericardium is involved, it often leads to pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, and pericardial effusion, an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity. Metastases to the myocardium are less common, but arise more commonly when cancer spreads via the blood. Primary cardiac tumors, on the other hand, are actually extremely rare. The most common type of primary tumors in adults — when they do happen — are myxomas. Myxomas are benign tumors that arise from the mesenchymal connective tissue inside the heart, as opposed to the actual myocytes, or heart cells, because the heart of an adult is fully developed and its cells, or myocytes, are permanent and don’t proliferate.   These masses are gelatinous in consistency, as a result of an abundance of ground substance on histology, and pedunculated, meaning attached to a peduncle, or a stalk of tissue.  With this big mass on a stick in the left atrium, when blood flows through the atrium it can sort of swing around and get close to the mitral valve, which can block blood from flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle through the mitral valve, causing syncopal episodes. Surgical removal of the myxoma is typically curative.The most common primary cardiac tumor in infants and children, as opposed to adults, are rhabdomyomas. Rhabdomyo refers to striated muscle tissue, or cardiac muscle tissue in this case, so rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of the heart that usually affect the ventricles. They are best considered hamartomas rather than a true neoplasm. Hamart means “fault,” so hamartomas are actually the result of an abnormal formation of normal tissue; basically, there was some fault in how the tissue grew. These developmental masses happen frequently in patients that also have tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder that causes these non-cancerous masses to form in various tissues. This is due to mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes, genes that usually suppress tumor growth; therefore, a mutation leads to myocyte overgrowth.  Most rhabdomyomas usually regress spontaneously. However, if they do cause symptoms, such as obstructing a valve or the outflow of blood from the heart, they may be surgically removed. ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap… The majority of cardiac tumors are secondary, where cancer somewhere else in the body metastasizes to the heart, usually through the lymphatic system. The most common primary cardiac tumors in adults are myxomas, which arise from mesenchymal connective tissue, while the most common in children are rhabdomyomas, which affect cardiac muscle tissue. Treatment for both, when necessary, is surgical removal.'],\n",
              "  60: [\"Central anti-adrenergics are a class of medications that’s not very commonly used these days. Their mechanism of action is to target the adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system, and prevent them from effectively releasing the catecholamines: norepinephrine and epinephrine.    So, the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system, so the brain and spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system, which includes all the nerves that connect the central nervous system to the muscles and organs. The peripheral nervous system can be divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary movement of our skeletal muscles; and the autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary movement of smooth muscles and glands of our organs.Now, the autonomic nervous system - which includes both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems - is made up of a relay that includes two neurons. We’ll focus on just the sympathetic nervous system. Signals for the autonomic nervous system start in the hypothalamus, at the base of the brain. Hypothalamic neurons have really long axons that carry signals all the way down to the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord nuclei, where they synapse with preganglionic neuron cell bodies. Here, they release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which causes the preganglionic neurons to transmit the signals down their relatively short axon, which exits the central nervous system via the spinal cord. These short nerve fibers reach the nearby sympathetic ganglion, which consists of many postganglionic neuron cell bodies. The postganglionic neurons are also called adrenergic neurons, because they release the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is also called noradrenaline; and to a much lesser degree, epinephrine, or adrenaline. These two catecholamines activate the adrenergic receptors on many different organs, which allow the sympathetic nervous system to trigger the fight or flight response that increases the heart rate and blood pressure, as well as slowing digestion. All of this maximizes blood flow to the muscles and brain, and can help you either run away from a threat, or fight it, which is why it’s also called the “fight or flight response.”Alright, so let’s zoom into the synapse between the hypothalamic neurons and the preganglionic neurons, which can be found throughout the brainstem and spinal cord.  The presynaptic terminal contains loads of tiny synaptic vesicles, each of which stores thousands of norepinephrine molecules. But for norepinephrine to be there in the first place, a precursor amino acid, called tyrosine, is taken up by the adrenergic neuron and gets converted to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, or L-DOPA for short, by an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase. Next, L-DOPA is converted by an enzyme called DOPA decarboxylase to dopamine, which is then packaged into the synaptic vesicles. The remaining dopamine will be broken down by a class of enzymes called monoamine oxidases, or MAOs for short. Okay, now once inside the vesicles, dopamine get converted into norepinephrine. And then, whenever the appropriate signal travels down the axon to the axon terminal, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane in order for norepinephrine to get released (or exocytosed) into the synaptic cleft and take action on the adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. Okay, but this release of norepinephrine is controlled through negative feedback inhibition. So when a pre-synaptic nerve terminal is stimulated to release a bunch of norepinephrine in the synapse, some of it will bind to a special type of receptor called an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, located on the presynaptic membrane. These alpha-2 receptors then inhibit further release of norepinephrine into the synapse, so the postsynaptic neuron doesn’t get over stimulated.Alright, so medications that act on adrenergic neurons of the brainstem to inhibit adrenergic signal transmission are called central anti-adrenergics. What these do, is collectively oppose the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. So overall, the heart rate and blood pressure decrease, digestive processes speed up, and the fight-or-flight response gets blocked.Okay, so central anti-adrenergics are divided into alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and a special drug called methyldopa. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla. This decreases the release of  norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, which leads to lower blood pressure. At the same time, alpha-2 receptor agonists, clonidine in particular, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors present in a special region at the front of the brain, called the prefrontal cortex, where they exert the same inhibitory effect on norepinephrine release. Moderating the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain helps tune out irrelevant stimuli and sharpens focus, so it’s useful in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD for short. Now, the main side effect of these medications is that blood pressure may fall too low and cause orthostatic hypotension.  Also, if someone quits taking them too abruptly, blood pressure may climb over the roof and cause severe rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic activity. Other side effects include sedation, fatigue, as well as nausea and gastric upset.Now, another central anti-adrenergic medication is methyldopa. Methyldopa looks like L-DOPA, so much that it fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine. Methyldopamine can’t get broken down by monoamine oxidases, so it builds up and moves into the synaptic vesicles and gets converted to methylnorepinephrine! Methylnorepinephrine then builds up inside the vesicles and pushes the true norepinephrine into the cytoplasm where they get chopped up by monoamine oxidases. So when a signal comes, methylnorepinephrine is released instead. And methylnorepinephrine not only can’t activate adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuron, but it can circle back to act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neuron membrane, leading to further inhibition of norepinephrine release. So, methyldopa can be given to lower blood pressure during pregnancy, since it’s safe for the baby. In general though, it’s not so commonly used due to its several side effects, ranging from mild ones, like drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, and gastric upset, to pretty severe ones like liver toxicity, allergic reactions, and hemolytic reactions or red blood cell breakdown.Now, we want to make a simple and fun mnemonic that’ll help you efficiently memorize and retain all these pharm facts! Okay, so let’s have an iguana driving a Benz, for guanabenz and another iguana is powdering her face, for guanfacine. In the backseat is a clown for clonidine.  And they head down a highway lane, called alpha-2, to remind you that they are alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and there’s a billboard with a giant brain to help you remember they act on the central nervous system. In the middle of the lane, a black cat trapped in a cage is drinking from a cup of cola, which represents the inhibition of catecholamine release. For the indications of these drugs, there’s a large blood pressure cuff sticking out of the trunk to represent hypertension. The clown is jumping up and down to show that clonidine is used to treat ADHD. For the major side effects, let’s use a billboard on the side of the road. So on the sign, there’s a picture of a basketball player getting a rebound, which represents rebound hypertension. And the fans are fainting from excitement to represent orthostatic hypotension. Okay, moving onto the next drug! Further down the alpha-2 highway, there’s a pregnant doberman carrying a slab of meat, for methyldopa, which is safe for use during pregnancy. It’s bullying a black kitty out of its box, to represent how this medication can displace catecholamines from their vesicles. For indications, let’s put a blood pressure cuff around the box for hypertension. Behind the doberman, we have a chewed up liver and some shredded red blood cells, since methyldopa causes liver toxicity and hemolysis.  ###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, central anti-adrenergics act in the central nervous system to block sympathetic outflow. They include alpha-2 agonists, like clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine, which inhibit catecholamine release through negative feedback control and are used to treat hypertension. Clonidine in particular, can also be used to treat ADHD. There's also methyldopa, which gets converted to the false neurotransmitter methylnorepinephrine which displaces norepinephrine, but also stimulates alpha-2 receptors. Methyldopa is effective in hypertension and is safe for use during pregnancy.\"],\n",

And then, whenever the appropriate signal travels down the axon to the axon terminal, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane in order for norepinephrine to get released (or exocytosed), into the synaptic cleft and take action on the adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. Now, each of these presynaptic neurons has small reuptake proteins, called Norepinephrine Transporters, or NETs for short, which pump norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft back into presynaptic neurons. Once inside the neuron, with the help of Vesicular Monoamine Transporter, or VMAT, norepinephrine gets packaged into pre-existing vesicles, waiting to be released once more. Just like dopamine, any bit of norepinephrine that’s left behind in the cytoplasm will be broken down by monoamine oxidases or MAOs. Alright, so medications that act on peripheral presynaptic adrenergic neurons to inhibit adrenergic signal transmission are called peripheral presynaptic anti-adrenergics. What these do, is collectively oppose the effects of the sympathetic nervous system - so, overall, heart rate and blood pressure decrease, digestion speeds up and the fight-or-flight response gets blocked. Okay, so peripheral presynaptic anti-adrenergics are further subdivided into those affecting norepinephrine synthesis, norepinephrine storage, and norepinephrine release. Now, there are inhibitors of norepinephrine synthesis, which include alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or metyrosine. Metyrosine looks like tyrosine, and it can bind to and inhibit the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. This means less tyrosine gets converted to L-DOPA, so, down the road, less norepinephrine is produced, and less gets released into the synaptic cleft. Metyrosine can be given to lower the blood pressure in individuals with pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla, which secretes too much catecholamines, causing extreme peaks of high blood pressure, or hypertension. The main side effect, though, is that blood pressure may fall too low, causing hypotension. Now, norepinephrine storage is mainly inhibited by another medication called reserpine. Reserpine’s job is to block the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter, or VMAT. What this means is that dopamine is prevented from getting stored into the synaptic vesicles and turning into norepinephrine. At the same time, recirculated norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft cannot get repackaged into the synaptic vesicles. Instead, both dopamine and norepinephrine build up in the cytoplasm, where they get chopped up by monoamine oxidases, or MAOs. The end result is a decrease in both norepinephrine and dopamine. This makes reserpine effective in controlling high blood pressure. However, it’s almost never used today, due to its poor absorption, slow metabolism, and most importantly, its long-term side effects on the central nervous system, where it causes the same depletion of dopamine and norepinephrine. This results in depression, drowsiness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Alright, now norepinephrine release is directly inhibited by guanethidine. Guanethidine gets gobbled up by the presynaptic terminal through norepinephrine transporters, so it directly competes with norepinephrine during its reuptake. So essentially, more norepinephrine remains active in the synaptic cleft, causing a transient increase in adrenergic signals, and thus, an increase in blood pressure. As guanethidine enters the presynaptic nerve, it accumulates in the synaptic vesicles, where it displaces norepinephrine. And soon enough, norepinephrine stores get depleted. At the same time, guanethidine blocks the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, preventing norepinephrine release into the synaptic cleft. All this leads to less stimulation of the postsynaptic adrenergic receptors, which can be useful in terms of lowering the blood pressure. However, just like reserpine, guanethidine is almost obsolete today, due to its poor absorption, slow metabolism, and most importantly, its initial hypertensive effect. Now, we want to make a simple and fun mnemonic that’ll help you efficiently memorize and retain all these pharm facts! Okay, so let’s have a toy factory with three workers. The first worker is building a toy black cat holding a cola can, for catecholamine synthesis. He’s about to be attacked by a tyrannosaurus holding a slab of meat, for metyrosine. It’s also snapping at a bird that’s half-crow and half-phoenix, since it’s used to treat hypertension in pheochromocytoma.  The next worker represents storage, so he’s packing boxes. Since the medications in this class affect both catecholamines and dopamine, let’s put a cola cat and a doberman doll in the box. He’s about to be attacked by a robot serpent, for reserpine. The robot serpent has a biological brain on its head to help you remember this medication is very active in the central nervous system, and could cause side effects like depression, so let’s have the robot serpent cry big sad tears. Finally, the last worker is pushing a cart full of cola cats out of the factory, which represents catecholamine release. Waiting for him is an iguana, who’s ready to have him for dinner, which represents guanethidine. Let’s put a pumped up blood pressure cuff on his tail, so you remember that this drug could initially worsen hypertension as a side effect. There’s also a worker who passed out from orthostatic hypotension in the middle of the factory, since all 3 groups of medications can cause this as a side effect.  Due to the unsafe condition of the factory, many of the non-essential workers, like the box packer and the cart pusher, eventually quit, so those medications filling those roles like reserpine and guanethidine are rarely used.###SUMMARYAll right, as a quick recap, peripheral presynaptic anti-adrenergics act on presynaptic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Metyrosine inhibits the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and prevents catecholamine synthesis; Reserpine prevents the storage of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synaptic vesicles; and guanethid ine blocks the release of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft. These medications are mainly used for treating hypertension, but reserpine and guanethidine are rarely used, due to their side effects. ']},\n",

The Reynolds number, denoted by Re, is used to determine whether blood flow is laminar or turbulent, with low Reynolds numbers indicating laminar flow and high Reynolds numbers indicating turbulent flow. Factors such as the density and viscosity of the blood, as well as the velocity of blood flow and the diameter of the blood vessel, can be used to calculate the Reynolds number. Anemia, with its lower red blood cell count and hematocrit, results in a lower Reynolds number due to the reduced viscosity of the blood. Similarly, the presence of a thrombus or blood clot in a blood vessel will increase the Reynolds number due to the reduction in diameter of the vessel. Shear refers to the difference in velocity of the blood between the center and walls of a blood vessel, with higher shear occurring near the walls and lower shear in the middle of the vessel.

As people age, healthy compliant arteries become stiffer and less compliant, leading to an increase in pulse pressure. Elasticity is related to the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. In the context of arteries, elasticity allows them to store energy during systole and release it during diastole, affecting blood pressure and pulse pressure.'],\n",
              "  7: [\"\\nThe main function of the heart is to circulate oxygenated blood to the body's tissues via the arteries and receive deoxygenated blood with waste products through the veins. This process happens in two stages: diastole (relaxation) and systole (contraction). During diastole, the left ventricle fills with blood up to 120ml, known as end-diastolic volume. At the end of systole, the left ventricle contracts to expel blood through the aorta, leaving behind an end-systolic volume of around 50ml. The difference between these volumes is called the stroke volume, which ranges from 70-120ml in healthy individuals. Another important measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume, typically ranging from 50-65%. These measurements help determine heart function and disease progression. Cardiac output is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate, providing the total volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle in a minute. Normal adults contain roughly 5L of blood, meaning every minute the entire volume passes through the left ventricle. Athletes can achieve high cardiac outputs of up to 35L/min. Blood flow is then distributed to different organs, with the liver receiving the most, followed by the kidneys. Kidney tissue perfusion is highest per gram of tissue compared to other organs.\"],\n",

It states that the amount of tension developed during systole depends on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin, which in turn depends on the length of the overlapping section between actin and myosin filaments. The longer the sarcomere, the more myosin heads will bind to actin and the stronger the contraction will be. Additionally, the more blood the ventricles hold during diastole, the more the sarcomeres will stretch, allowing more myosin heads to bind to actin and leading to a stronger contraction and increased stroke volume. However, if the ventricles become too full, the sarcomeres will become too long, causing fewer myosin heads to bind to actin and a weaker contraction.'],\n",

They show how these values change throughout each stage of the cycle, including diastole and systole. The loops help to understand the effects of changes in key factors such as preload, afterload, and contractility on the heart's performance. When preload increases, the end-diastolic volume expands, leading to increased stroke work. Conversely, when afterload increases, the end-systolic pressure rises, reducing the stroke volume and stabilizing the stroke work. Contractility influences the duration of the ejection phase, resulting in varying stroke volumes and thus stroke work.\"],\n",

Here\\'s a summary of the information provided:\\n\\nThe human body contains specialized cells called \"pacemaker\" cells located in specific areas of the heart that are responsible for generating the electrical impulses that regulate the heartbeat. These pacemaker cells work together with other types of heart cells (called \"cardiac muscle cells\") to create a functional syncytium that allows the heart to function properly.\\n\\nThe initiation of an action potential in a pacemaker cell is caused by depolarization, which occurs when certain ions (such as sodium) move across the cell membrane. This depolarization wave triggers a series of events within the pacemaker cell that ultimately lead to the release of an electrical impulse that travels to other parts of the heart.\\n\\nIn order to understand how depolarization works, it\\'s helpful to know about the role of ion channels in the movement of ions across cell membranes. Different types of ion channels respond to different stimuli (such as changes in the membrane potential), and their presence and behavior help to regulate the flow of ions and therefore the electrical activity of the cell.'],\n",
              "  12: ['\\nThe cardiac excitability refers to the ability of myocytes or myocardial cells to be depolarized or generate an action potential. This process is influenced by the presence of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, which determine whether or not the cell will depolarize based on their readiness. A more excitable cell will have more of these channels in the ready state, while a less excitable cell will have most of them inactivated. The process of depolarization involves a series of events including the entry of positive ions such as sodium and calcium through gap junctions, followed by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a surge of Na+ ions into the cell and resulting in depolarization. After the upstroke, the channels become inactivated, remaining closed and unavailable for another depolarization until they recover during the repolarization phase. There are three phases of the action potential: the upstroke, the plateau, the repolarization, and the refractory periods. The absolute refractory period occurs when all of the sodium channels are inactivated, preventing further depolarizations. The effective refractory period occurs when the cell has emerged from the absolute refractory period but is still not fully excitable. The relative refractory period follows, with some of the sodium channels having recovered and becoming available for another depolarization. The final stage is the supranormal period, where the cell is more excitable than usual due to the recovery of all sodium channels.'],\n",
              "  13: ['\\nThe text describes the mechanism of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, which is the relationship between electrical signals (action potentials) and mechanical changes (contraction) in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes are connected by gap junctions and held together by desmosomes. They have T-tubules, which increase their surface area, and sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores intracellular calcium. When a cardiomyocyte depolarizes, calcium ions move from one cell to another via gap junctions and trigger further depolarizations. The presence of T-tubules helps bring calcium deeper into the cell, where it binds to ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and releases more calcium into the cell, leading to activation of myofilaments and cell contraction. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and expose actin binding sites, allowing myosin heads to bind and pull actin filaments past each other. The process uses ATP and eventually returns the calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.'],\n",

It shows how the depolarization wave moves during each heartbeat, and can help diagnose abnormalities in heart function. Normal sinus rhythm is shown by a single heartbeat on an ECG, starting with the sinoatrial node and moving towards the apex of the heart. The depolarization wave moves faster through pacemaker cells than through the rest of the heart muscle cells. Ions can flow between cells during depolarization. The ECG measures changes in time (X-axis) and voltage (Y-axis), with zero being the isoelectric line.

Reading an ECG involves identifying the QRS transition, which occurs when the QRS complex changes from mostly negative to mostly positive in the chest leads. The QRS transition zone shifts based on factors like chest lead placement and heart anatomy. Alterations to the heart's overall QRS vector, such as those caused by scar tissue from a myocardial infarction or thickening of the muscle wall due to hypertrophy, can move the QRS transition zone. Right ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular infarction can rotate the QRS transition zone rightward, while left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular infarction can rotate it leftward.\"],\n",

It involves two types of baroreceptors: one located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, and the other in the walls of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery/veins. High blood pressure triggers the former, while low blood volume triggers the latter. Both types fire neural impulses to the brainstem's cardiovascular centers, which then send signals to either constrict blood vessels and slow down the heart rate (lowering blood pressure), or relax blood vessels and speed up the heart rate (raising blood pressure).\"],\n",
              "  19: ['\\n        Peripheral and central chemoreceptors play important roles in regulating breathing and circulation. Peripheral chemoreceptors sense changes in the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood vessels and transmit signals to the brainstem to adjust the activity of the vasomotor and cardiovascular centers. The vasomotor center controls the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, limiting blood flow to peripheral organs and increasing venous return to the heart. Meanwhile, the cardiac accelerator center is inhibited, reducing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart. Airway and breathing are regulated through the integration of inputs from both peripheral and central chemoreceptors. Central chemoreceptors monitor the levels of carbon dioxide and pH in the cerebrospinal fluid and trigger the respiratory centers to increase respiratory drive when necessary. They also respond to changes in blood flow to the brain, leading to the Cushing reaction, which increases blood pressure to maintain adequate perfusion of the brain.'],\n",

It occurs when one of the vessels supplying blood to the heart gets blocked, leading to death of heart muscle. There's two types of MI, NSTEMI and STEMI. NSTEMI doesn't show up on an ECG as well as STEMI does, and it's caused by partial infarct of the wall. STEMI has ST-segment elevation on ECG and involves the whole wall thickness. Signs and symptoms include severe and crushing chest pain or pressure, maybe radiation to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, nausea, fatigue, and dyspnea. Labs can confirm with high sensitivity troponin I, Troponin T, and CK-MB. Risk of arrhythmias is high immediately following an MI. Depending on how much contractile tissue is affected, patients might develop cardiogenic shock. Pericarditis and inflammation can occur in the days following an infarction. Healing process takes weeks to months and results in granulation tissue. Complications include heart failure. Fibrinolytic therapy, angioplasty, and PCI may be performed to restore blood flow. Reperfusion injury can occur due to returning blood flow, causing tissue damage.

The type of ectopic focus determines where the QRS complex appears on an ECG.\\n\\nThere are three scenarios in which PVCs can occur: (1) when the ectopic focus arises from within the ventricles, (2) when the ectopic focus arises from the sinoatrial junction, and (3) when the ectopic focus arises from the atrioventricular node. Each of these scenarios results in a different type of QRS complex.\\n\\nCompensatory pauses occur when a normal sinus complex lands exactly two times the normal sinus interval, while noncompensatory pauses occur when the sinus complex lands less than two times the normal sinus interval.

Anatomical reentry happens when there is scar tissue present in the heart, which disrupts the electrical signals. External electrical stimulation can also induce VF. Once VF begins, it can be difficult to stop without defibrillation, which involves delivering a high-energy shock to the heart to restore normal rhythm.

They're divided into two categories: alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and methyldopa. Examples of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla, to decrease the release of norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, resulting in lower blood pressure. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients benefit from these medications because alpha-2 receptor agonists, particularly clonidine, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors present in the prefrontal cortex to moderate the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain, tuning out irrelevant stimuli and sharpening focus. However, the most common side effects are orthostatic hypotension and rebound hypertension upon sudden discontinuation. Methyldopa is another central anti-adrenergic medication that works differently. It looks like L-DOPA and fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine, which can’t be broken down by monoamine oxidases. Built-up methyldopamine then circles back to act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neuron membrane, leading to further inhibition of norepinephrine release. Methyldopa is safe for pregnant women and can be used to lower blood pressure. Side effects include liver toxicity, allergic reactions, and hemolytic reactions.

The stroke volume can vary depending on factors such as a person's size, and is typically around 70 milliliters. Another important measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume. Normal values range from 50-65%, while low values could indicate heart disease.

When enough positive ions (such as sodium and calcium) enter the cell through gap junctions, the voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing a large influx of sodium ions that leads to depolarization. After the upstroke of the action potential, the sodium channels close and become inactivated, making the cell refractory to further depolarizations for a period known as the absolute refractory period. As the cell repolarizes, the sodium channels begin to recover, and the cell enters the relative refractory period, during which it requires a larger stimulus to depolarize. Eventually, the cell reaches the supranormal period, where it is more excitable than usual due to the complete recovery of the sodium channels.'],\n",

T-tubules extend the surface area of the cardiomyocyte and help transport intracellular calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores and releases calcium to activate myofilaments and cause contraction. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and expose actin binding sites, causing myosin heads to bind and pull actin filaments past each other.

Low blood pressure triggers a cascade of events that decrease cardiac output, decrease total peripheral resistance, and allow blood to pool in the periphery, ultimately leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Conversely, high blood pressure triggers similar events that raise blood pressure. Additionally, there are cardiopulmonary baroreceptors located in the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery and veins that primarily regulate blood volume and are known as low-pressure or volume baroreceptors.

Peripheral chemoreceptors detect low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels and send impulses to the brainstem to increase breathing and heart rate. Central chemoreceptors in the brainstem monitor the carbon dioxide level and pH in the cerebrospinal fluid and trigger an increase in respiratory drive.

The former is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and results in no permanent damage, while the latter is a true infarction and can cause permanent damage.\\n\\nIn the first few hours after an MI, the body tries to protect the heart by increasing its output and dilating blood vessels. However, if the infarction is large, the body cannot compensate and the heart may stop altogether. This is called a ventricular fibrillation (VF).

The pressure difference between the left and right sides of the heart causes oxygenated blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, resulting in increased oxygen saturation levels in the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery. If an embolus forms and enters the ASD, it could travel to the lungs and cause complications such as paradoxical embolism. Some ASDs can close on their own, while others require surgery to prevent future complications.\"],\n",

This is due to a variety of factors, including age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, excessive alcohol use, and genetics. Tissue heterogeneity within the atria can cause multiple wavelets of conduction that result in unpredictable and chaotic behavior. The automatic focus theory suggests that a specific area of cells in the atria initiates AF by rapidly firing electrical impulses. Paroxysmal AF events can eventually lead to persistent AF, which can last for years and increase the risk of stroke. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition and can include medications, pacemakers, and catheter ablations.'],\n",

There are two types of PVCs: those that arise from an ectopic focus in the atria and those that arise from an ectopic focus in the ventricles. PVCs can occur due to various factors such as stress, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, certain medications, and medical conditions. They can also result from surgery, trauma, or radiation therapy. PVCs can be classified based on their location and frequency. Some common locations include the His-Purkinje system, the coronary artery vasculature, and the conductive system of the ventricles. Frequent PVCs can lead to compensatory mechanisms that allow the heart to continue functioning normally. However, PVCs can also disrupt the normal cardiac rhythm and potentially lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmic death.\\n\\nThe ECG is useful in identifying PVCs by showing a distinct QRS complex. Lead V1 can help determine the site of the ectopic focus. Compensatory pauses occur when a normal sinus complex lands exactly two times the normal sinus interval, while noncompensatory pauses occur when the sinus complex lands less than two times the normal sinus interval. Premature ventricular contractions can occur at different stages of the cardiac cycle and can produce different ECG patterns. Bigeminy and trigeminy refer to specific patterns of premature ventricular contractions. While most PVCs do not require treatment, persistent symptoms may warrant treatment with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. Radiofrequency ablation can be performed if an ectopic focus triggers ventricular arrhythmias.'],\n",

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occur when ventricular pacemaker cells fire at the wrong time, but the surrounding cells have similar properties, causing the ventricles to contract. Three PVCs in a row is considered ventricular tachycardia (VT), which can progress to VF. Functional reentry occurs when the wave of conduction curves and spirals out of control due to differences in cell properties. Anatomical reentry happens when there is scar tissue present from a previous heart attack. External electrical stimulation can also induce VF. Once VF begins, the only reliable way to stop it is through defibrillation, either through external electrical stimulation or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

There are several different types of heart block, including atrioventricular (AV) block, which can either be first, second, or third degree. First degree AV block results in a slightly delayed signal, while second degree AV block sees the signal becoming increasingly delayed until it is eventually blocked altogether. Third degree, or complete heart block, occurs when the signal is completely blocked all the time.

They're divided into two categories: alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and methyldopa. Examples of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla, to decrease the release of norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, resulting in lower blood pressure. Meanwhile, alpha-2 receptor agonists, particularly clonidine, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the prefrontal cortex to moderate the amount of norepinephrine in this area of the brain, helping to tune out irrelevant stimuli and sharpen focus. However, the main side effect of these medications is that blood pressure may fall too low and cause orthostatic hypotension. If someone quits taking them too abruptly, blood pressure may climb over the roof and cause severe rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic activity. Other side effects include sedation, fatigue, nausea, and gastric upset. Methyldopa is another central anti-adrenergic medication that works differently than alpha-2 receptor agonists. It looks like L-DOPA, so it fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine. Methyldopamine can’t be broken down by monoamine oxidases, so it builds up and moves into the synaptic vesicles, where it gets converted to methylnorepinephrine. Methylnorepinephrine then builds up inside the vesicles and pushes the true norepinephrine into the cytoplasm, where it gets chopped up by monoamine oxidases.

When this happens, the excess blood volume creates a greater pressure on the heart with each beat, leading to an increase in afterload. Over time, this extra workload leads to thickening of the heart muscle, which becomes less efficient and contributes to the development of heart failure.In summary, the compliance of blood vessels determines the relationship between blood volume and pressure, and the elasticity of the vessels affects the recoil or snap back of the vessel walls after each beat of the heart.

In cases of aortic aneurysm rupture, patients may experience hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and a sensation of a lump in the throat.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\n\\nImaging techniques such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are used to confirm the presence of an aneurysm and determine its size and location. Ultrasonography is also used to detect aneurysms, particularly in the case of intracranial aneurysms. Other methods include transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and digital subtraction angiography.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nTreatment options depend on the size, location, and degree of expansion of the aneurysm, as well as the presence of symptoms. Small aneurysms with no symptoms may be monitored through regular imaging studies, while larger aneurysms or those that are at high risk of rupturing may require surgical intervention. Endovascular repair involves the use of a stent-graft to reinforce the damaged vessel wall and redirect blood flow away from the aneurysm. Open surgery involves removing the damaged section of the vessel and replacing it with a graft. Both procedures carry risks and benefits and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.'],\n",

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",

It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors. The final step in the cascade is the formation of fibrin, which strengthens the clot and helps to maintain its stability.'],\n",

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not produce any clinical symptoms.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity produced by the PAC can stimulate the sensory nerves that detect changes in heart rate, producing the sensation of palpitations. Palpitations can also be caused by other factors such as anxiety or panic disorder.'],\n",

Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to draw out the fluid.

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",

It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors.

It is characterized by an underdeveloped left ventricle and a smallish aortic and mitral valve.\\n* Cause of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: The exact mechanism that causes HLHS isn\\'t known, but one popular theory is that there might be some other primary congenital heart defect that reduces the blood flow through the LV and outflow tract during fetal development, so that part of the heart does not grow and develop normally.\\n* Effects of hypoplastic left heart syndrome on the heart: Infants with HLHS have a severely underdeveloped left ventricle and a small aortic and mitral valve. This results in poor blood circulation to the body, leading to cyanosis (bluish purple discoloration of the skin). Additionally, the aortic valve and mitral valve might be either too small to allow enough blood to flow through, or they might be absent altogether, which is called atresia.\\n* Prognosis for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Without intervention, HLHS is fatal.

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not produce any clinical symptoms.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity produced by the PAC can stimulate the sensory nerves that detect changes in heart rate, producing the sensation of palpitations. Palpitations can also be caused by other factors such as anxiety or panic disorder.'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to withdraw the fluid. Finally, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and any changes in symptoms is essential to ensure proper management of the condition.\"],\n",

The loop consists of four phases: ventricular filling, isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation. The PV loop helps explain how changes in various factors affect the heart's performance.\\n\\nAn increase in preload, which refers to the amount of blood in the left ventricle during diastole, results in a larger end-diastolic volume and a stronger contraction. This leads to a larger pressure-volume loop and increased stroke work. Conversely, if preload decreases, the opposite occurs.\\n\\nAfterload, which refers to the resistance offered by the blood vessels to blood flow, affects the pressure required for the left ventricle to eject blood. If afterload increases, the pressure required for ejection also increases, leading to a later opening of the aortic valve and a decrease in stroke volume. A decrease in afterload results in the opposite effect.\\n\\nContractility, which refers to the ability of the heart muscle to contract, affects the duration of the ejection phase. Higher contractility leads to a longer ejection phase and a greater stroke volume, resulting in a larger pressure-volume loop and increased stroke work. Lower contractility leads to a shorter ejection phase and a smaller stroke volume, resulting in a smaller pressure-volume loop and decreased stroke work.\\n\\nOverall, the PV loop provides valuable insight into how changes in these factors impact the heart's performance and can help diagnose cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure.\"],\n",

It is estimated that over 3 million people in the UK have COPD, making it one of the most common respiratory diseases worldwide. As the disease progresses, patients experience increasing breathlessness, cough and sputum production, leading to reduced quality of life and premature mortality. End-of-life care for patients with COPD is essential to ensure that their remaining days are comfortable and dignified. This article will discuss the key aspects of end-of-life care for patients with COPD.\\n\\n### Identifying when end-of-life care is needed\\n\\nThe identification of end-of-life care for patients with COPD requires recognition of several factors: advanced stage of the disease, comorbidities, poor health status, and declining functional capacity. Patients who are bedridden, unable to perform activities of daily living, or experiencing frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization are likely to require end-of-life care. Additionally, patients who express feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, or depression should be identified early so that appropriate support can be provided.\\n\\n### Communication and breaking bad news\\n\\nEffective communication is crucial in end-of-life care for patients with COPD. Healthcare professionals must communicate honestly and sensitively with patients about their condition, treatment options, and prognosis. Breaking bad news requires skill and empathy, and healthcare providers should provide emotional support to help patients process the information. Open communication helps patients make informed decisions regarding their care preferences, such as whether they want aggressive treatments or comfort measures only.\\n\\n### Advance Care Planning\\n\\nAdvance care planning involves a process of discussion and decision-making between patients, family members, and healthcare providers. The goal is to establish a plan that aligns with patient values, beliefs, and goals for end-of-life care. This includes identifying preferred place of death, type of medical interventions, and ethical considerations such as organ donation. Advanced care plans should be reviewed'],\n",

With Kawasaki disease, the immune system attacks the arteries, leading to damage to the endothelial cells in the blood vessels and exposure of the underlying collagen and tissue factor in the middle layer of the blood vessel (tunica media). This leads to blood coagulation, aneurysm formation, and potential heart complications such as myocardial infarction.\\n\\nWho does Kawasaki disease primarily affect?\\n\\nAnswer: Kawasaki disease primarily affects infants and young children under the age of five, with a higher incidence in boys.\\n\\nWhat is the course of Kawasaki disease?\\n\\nAnswer: Kawasaki disease is a self-limiting illness, meaning that the inflammation resolves on its own within six to eight weeks. However, if left untreated, there is a significant risk of developing heart complications, including myocardial infarction. Classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease include conjunctivitis with limbus sparing, a strawberry tongue, adenopathy, a rash that extends across multiple parts of the body, and high fever. Lab tests can provide clues to the diagnosis, including elevations in white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as microscopic urinalysis showing mononuclear white blood cells without evidence of bacteria. An echocardiogram can confirm the presence of vasculitis in the coronary arteries. Diagnosis requires four of the five CRASH symptoms plus a fever lasting five or more days.

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",
              "  27: ['\\n### 10. What is the role of the coagulation cascade?\\nThe coagulation cascade plays a crucial role in stopping bleeding following injury to a blood vessel. It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors. The final step in the cascade is the formation of fibrin, which strengthens the clot and helps to maintain its stability.'],\n",

How do you treat non small cell lung cancer?\\n        * Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated using a variety of methods including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The choice of treatment will depend on factors such as the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and whether the cancer has spread beyond the lungs. Surgery is used to remove the cancer if possible, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells, while chemotherapy uses drugs to target and destroy cancer cells. Combination therapies, such as surgery followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy, are also commonly used. Clinical trials testing new treatments are always available for patients with NSCLC.\\n    4. Explain what a clinical trial is and why would someone participate in one?\\n        A clinical trial is a research study conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a potential new treatment or medical device. These studies involve people who volunteer to take part and receive specific interventions or medications that are being tested. Participants are carefully monitored and their health is evaluated throughout the trial. Clinical trials offer hope for many people who have exhausted all other options for treating their disease.

How is TGA treated?\\n\\nComplete TGA is a condition where both great arteries are transposed, while transposition of the great arteries refers specifically to the situation where the aorta is in front of the pulmonary artery. Complete TGA is more severe than transposition of the great arteries because it results in blood never being oxygenated in the right side of the heart and never deoxygenated in the left side of the heart. Complications of TGA include cyanosis, heart failure, and the need for surgical intervention. Treatment options may include medication or surgery, depending on the severity of the condition.'],\n",

The drug is administered intravenously, typically via a central line placed in the umbilical vein before surgery. The infusion is started at a low dose and gradually increased over several hours to achieve the desired effect. The typical duration of therapy is 48–72 hours, although it may be shorter if the infant undergoes surgery earlier. During therapy, the infant's vital signs are closely monitored, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory effort, and temperature.

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not affect the function of the heart.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity caused by the PAC can interfere with the normal filling of the heart chambers, leading to a sensation of fluttering or racing of the heart.\\n* What is the relationship between the site of the ectopic focus and the type of PAC produced?\\nThe site of the ectopic focus determines the type of premature atrial contraction (PAC) produced. Different locations of the ectopic focus correspond to specific types of PACs with characteristic ECG patterns. For example'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and stabilize blood pressure. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to withdraw the fluid. Finally, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and any changes in symptoms is essential to ensure proper management of the condition.\"],\n",

This can happen with conditions such as lymphadenitis (inflammation of a lymph node), which may occur due to a bacterial or viral infection, or cancer that spreads to the lymph nodes. Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include filariasis, a parasitic disease caused by thread-like worms, and sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the skin, eyes, and lungs.\\n\\nLymphangitis is a serious infection that occurs when bacteria or other germs enter the lymphatic system via a break in the skin, causing swelling, pain, fever, and sometimes even shock. It typically happens after surgery or trauma, and requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nHypoproteinemia, a condition characterized by low levels of proteins in the blood, can lead to edema, which is excessive accumulation of fluid in the spaces between cells. This can result from malnutrition, kidney or liver disease, or other medical conditions.\\n\\nPhlebitis is inflammation of a vein, which can cause swelling, warmth, and tenderness in the affected area. It commonly occurs in the legs, particularly after prolonged periods of inactivity, such as sitting or standing still for long hours.\\n\\nThrombophlebitis is a more severe form of phlebitis that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein, leading to swelling, pain, and tenderness in the affected limb. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the lymphatic system is a vital network responsible for maintaining proper fluid balance, removing waste products, and supporting the immune system. While it functions efficiently under normal circumstances, disruptions or diseases of the lymphatic system can lead to various complications. Understanding how the lymphatic system works helps us appreciate its importance in our overall health and wellbeing.\\n```\"],\n",

Specifically, the P wave represents the depolarization of the atria, which occurs simultaneously with the depolarization of the ventricles (the \"bundle branch block\"). The P wave therefore indicates the precise moment when the atria begin to contract and fill the ventricles with blood. Because the atria contract before the ventricles, the P wave appears before the QRS complex on the ECG, and its shape reflects the speed at which the depolarization wave travels through the atria compared to the ventricles. If the P wave is abnormal in some way, it may indicate a problem with the electrical conduction of the heart.'],\n",

How do we interpret the results?\\n    \\nAn ECG is a test that uses electrical signals to create a picture of the heart's activity. It shows how the electricity flowing through the heart changes over time. Electrodes are placed on various parts of the body to detect these electrical signals. These signals are then recorded and analyzed to provide information about the heart's function.\\n\\nElectrodes are typically placed on the chest (thorax) for a standard ECG. There are several leads that can be used for this purpose, including lead I, lead II, and lead III. Lead II is the most commonly used lead for a standard ECG. It consists of two electrodes: one placed on the right arm and the other on the left leg.\\n\\nTo interpret the results of an ECG, it is important to understand the different segments of the trace. The P-QRS-T segment represents the duration of the heart's contraction. The P-wave indicates atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents repolarization of the ventricles. The ST segment represents the period between the end of the T-wave and the beginning of the next cycle. Abnormalities in any part of the ECG trace may indicate a problem with the heart's electrical activity.\"],\n",

Aneurysms may be detected incidentally during routine medical examination or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Alternatively, aneurysms may cause symptoms such as sharp, persistent, localized or generalized throbbing or aching pain, depending on the site and size of the aneurysm, and the presence of any associated inflammatory or thrombotic processes. Ruptured aneurysms typically present with acute, severe, focal neurological deficits, accompanied by severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and possible loss of consciousness. Other systemic manifestations include hypertension, tachycardia, and hypotension.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\n\\nImaging techniques such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are used to confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm and determine its size and location. Contrast agents are injected into the patient's circulatory system to highlight the aneurysm and surrounding vessels on X-ray images. Ultrasound and echocardiography can also be used to visualize the aneurysm and assess its impact on cardiac function.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nTreatment options for aneurysms depend on the size, location, and degree of involvement of the affected organ or vessel. Surgery is the primary treatment option for most aneurysms, involving either open surgical repair or endovascular stent graft placement. Endovascular therapy involves inserting a stent-graft through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery, which is guided to the site of the aneurysm and deployed to reinforce the damaged vessel wall. Open surgical repair involves exposing the aneurysm and replacing the damaged segment of the vessel with a synthetic graft. Both procedures carry risks and benefits, and the choice of procedure depends on various factors such as the size and location of the aneurysm, the patient's overall health\"],\n",

The skin may appear reddish or blue due to the increased blood flow to the area. On examination, a physician will perform a physical exam to assess for signs of DVT, including edema (swelling), erythema (redness), warmth, and tenderness in the affected extremity. Additionally, a duplex Doppler ultrasound is used to confirm the diagnosis of DVT by visualizing the blood flow in the veins. Other diagnostic tests that may be ordered include a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for any evidence of bleeding or clotting abnormalities, and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans to look for any associated injuries or other causes of the patient's symptoms.It is essential to differentiate between deep vein thrombosis and other conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as cellulitis or a musculoskeletal injury.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of deep vein thrombosis involves a complex interplay of various mechanisms, including blood flow stasis, hypercoagulable states, and damage to the endothelium. Blood flow stasis can occur due to prolonged immobility or surgery, which can result in the formation of a thrombus. Hypercoagulable states can be caused by inherited or acquired risk factors, such as congenital or acquired deficiencies in anticoagulants, or exposure to environmental toxins. Finally, damage to the endothelium can expose subendothelial structures, such as collagen and tissue factor, which can initiate the coagulation cascade and promote thrombus formation.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is primarily based on clinical presentation and confirmed by imaging studies, such as duplex Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Immediate steps include establishing IV access, initiating fluid resuscitation, monitoring vital signs closely, and providing oxygen support. Additionally, drugs may be given depending on the type of shock. For instance, pressor agents like dopamine or noradrenaline may be given to patients experiencing hypovolemic shock while those with cardiogenic shock may benefit from diuretics to remove excess fluid from the circulatory system. In cases of distributive shock, fluids may be given to improve blood pressure and counteract the effects of vasodilation.

It allows oxygenated blood to flow from the umbilical vein to the right atrium, bypassing the non-functional lungs. After birth, the foramen ovale closes to reliably use the lungs for oxygenation.'],\n",

AVRT occurs due to an accessory pathway, usually the Bundle of Kent, connecting the atria and ventricles, allowing the electrical impulse to circulate repeatedly between the two chambers. AVNRT, on the other hand, occurs due to two separate electrical pathways within the atrioventricular node (AVN), one with slow electrical conduction (alpha pathway) and the other with fast conduction (beta pathway). When the impulse travels down the fast pathway, it meets the slower signal coming down the other pathway, leading to a brief moment of electrical activity in both paths simultaneously, resulting in a reentry loop.'],\n",

Just because someone has a certain type of heart rhythm on their ECG doesn't mean that's all they have. There are many types of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), and some of them can mimic each other. SVT is a group of fast heart rates that arise above the ventricles. They're usually caused by abnormal electrical signals in the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) nodes.

It has three leaflets that open and close during each beat of the heart. Tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backwards. Rheumatic heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and damage to the papillary muscles from a heart attack can all cause this condition. Congenital conditions such as Ebstein's anomaly may also contribute. Treatment typically focuses on managing fluid balance and addressing any underlying conditions. Tricuspid valve stenosis occurs when the valve does not open properly, making it difficult for blood to flow into the right ventricle.

Additionally, they may have a decreasing intensity of the murmur during expiration, which is known as a \"timing\" or \"midsystolic\" murmur. ECG findings may show signs of both hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction.

It typically happens after surgery or trauma, and requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nHypoproteinemia, a condition characterized by low levels of proteins in the blood, can lead to edema, which is excessive accumulation of fluid in the spaces between cells. This can result from malnutrition, kidney or liver disease, or other medical conditions.\\n\\nPhlebitis is inflammation of a vein, which can cause swelling, warmth, and tenderness in the affected area. It commonly occurs in the legs, particularly after prolonged periods of inactivity, such as sitting or standing still for long hours.\\n\\nThrombophlebitis is a more severe form of phlebitis that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein, leading to swelling, pain, and tenderness in the affected limb. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the lymphatic system is a vital network responsible for maintaining proper fluid balance, removing waste products, and supporting the immune system.

They consist of four main phases: 1) end-diastolic, 2) isovolumetric contraction, 3) ejection, and 4) isovolumetric relaxation. During each phase, specific events occur, such as the opening and closing of heart valves and changes in ventricular pressure and volume. These events lead to the calculation of important measurements, such as stroke volume, ejection fraction, and pulse pressure. Understanding PV loops helps medical professionals assess heart function and diagnose cardiovascular conditions.'],\n",

If the person uses their legs (preload) to push against the ground harder, they will be able to lift the object off the ground with less effort. This is similar to an increase in preload, as the left ventricle needs to contract less to pump blood out. On the other hand, if someone puts weights on the person's shoulders (afterload), it will require more effort to lift the object, as the weight adds resistance. Similarly, an increase in afterload, as the left ventricle must work harder to overcome the increased pressure in order to pump blood out. Lastly, imagine the person taking a drug that helps them contract their leg muscles more strongly (contractility). This will allow them to lift the object off the ground with greater ease, just like an increase in contractility allows the left ventricle to pump blood out more easily, resulting in a larger stroke volume and a larger pressure-volume loop.\"],\n",

Peripheral vascular disease happens when one of these arteries becomes narrowed, which reduces blood flow; this often affects the limbs.Peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, usually involves the arteries, so sometimes it’s also referred to as peripheral artery disease or PAD. PVD is usually caused by a blockage, called organic PVD, that is most commonly created by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of lipids and fibrous material just under the inner lining of the blood vessel, called the tunica intima. When plaque builds up, it narrows the artery, which reduces perfusion to whatever tissue it tends to supply; this buildup usually happens over the course of many years. However, the vessel could be blocked by an embolus, which can happen suddenly if a blood clot from some upstream artery lodges in a peripheral artery; this clot would obviously stop blood flow from getting to the tissue the vessel supplies.   Besides organic PVDs, there are also functional PVDs. With functional PVDs, blood vessels stop blood flow by changing diameter, such as with vasospasms, where the vessel constricts and blood flow is reduced. This type of PVD is usually short term, and can come and go.  The arteries supplying the legs are the most commonly affected vessels in peripheral vascular disease. When less blood gets to the muscle tissue in the legs, the tissue receives less oxygen and becomes ischemic. Ischemic cells release adenosine, a type of signaling molecule, which is thought to affect nerves in these areas; this is felt as pain. This pain in the legs is often referred to as claudication. Sometimes, even though blood flow is narrowed with PVD, when a person is at rest,'],\n",

Aneurysms may be detected incidentally during routine medical examination or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Alternatively, aneurysms may cause symptoms such as sharp, persistent, localized or generalized throbbing or aching pain, depending on the site and size of the aneurysm, and the presence of any associated inflammatory or thrombotic processes. Ruptured aneurysms typically present with acute, severe, focal neurological deficits, accompanied by severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and possible loss of consciousness. Other systemic manifestations include hypertension, tachycardia, and hypotension.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\n\\nImaging techniques such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are used to confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm and determine its size and location. Contrast agents are injected into the patient's circulatory system to highlight the aneurysm and surrounding vessels on X-ray images. Ultrasound and echocardiography can also be used to visualize the aneurysm and assess its impact on cardiac function.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nTreatment options for aneurysms depend on the size, location, and degree of involvement of the affected organ or vessel. Surgery is the primary treatment option for most aneurysms, involving either open surgical repair or endovascular stent graft placement. Endovascular therapy involves inserting a stent-graft through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery, which is guided to the site of the aneurysm and deployed to reinforce the damaged vessel wall. Open surgical repair involves exposing the aneurysm and replacing the damaged segment of the vessel with a synthetic graft. Both procedures carry risks and benefits, and the choice of procedure depends on various factors such as the size and location of the aneurysm, the patient's overall health\"],\n",

The skin may appear reddish or blue due to the increased blood flow to the area. On examination, a physician will perform a physical exam to assess for signs of DVT, including edema (swelling), erythema (redness), warmth, and tenderness in the affected extremity. Additionally, a duplex Doppler ultrasound is used to confirm the diagnosis of DVT by visualizing the blood flow in the veins. Other diagnostic tests that may be ordered include a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for any evidence of bleeding or clotting abnormalities, and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans to look for any associated injuries or other causes of the patient's symptoms.It is essential to differentiate between deep vein thrombosis and other conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as cellulitis or a musculoskeletal injury.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of deep vein thrombosis involves a complex interplay of various mechanisms, including blood flow stasis, hypercoagulable states, and damage to the endothelium. Blood flow stasis can occur due to prolonged immobility or surgery, which can result in the formation of a thrombus. Hypercoagulable states can be caused by inherited or acquired risk factors, such as congenital or acquired deficiencies in anticoagulants, or exposure to environmental toxins. Finally, damage to the endothelium can expose subendothelial structures, such as collagen and tissue factor, which can initiate the coagulation cascade and promote thrombus formation.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is primarily based on clinical presentation and confirmed by imaging studies, such as duplex Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The first step is to identify the underlying cause of shock and prioritize treatments accordingly. However, some basic principles remain constant regardless of the specific type of shock. Immediate steps include establishing IV access, initiating fluid resuscitation, monitoring vital signs closely, and providing oxygen support. Additionally, drugs may be given depending on the type of shock. For instance, pressor agents like dopamine or noradrenaline may be given to patients experiencing hypovolemic shock while those with cardiogenic shock may benefit from diuretics to remove excess fluid from the circulatory system. In cases of distributive shock, fluids may be given to improve blood pressure and counteract the effects of vasodilation. Finally, any underlying conditions leading to shock must be addressed promptly.'],\n",

From the pulmonary artery, it comes back to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and the whole process restarts. The \"great arteries,\" are the two main arteries taking blood away from the heart: the aorta and pulmonary artery. \"Transposing\" means that two things switch places with each other.

On the left side, blood is now pumped from the left ventricle, to the pulmonary artery, and to the lungs; it then comes back to the left atrium and left ventricle, and restarts the circuit. On the right side, blood is pumped out of the right ventricle through the aorta, and then goes to the body; blood comes back the the right atrium and right ventricle, and restarts the circuit. Blood on the right side therefore never gets oxygenated, and blood on the left side never gets deoxygenated. This isn\\'t good.

It consists of three waves: the initial R-wave, representing atrial depolarization, followed by the S-wave, representing the passage of electrical activity through the atria, and the final T-wave, representing ventricular repolarization. The QRS complex arises from the superposition of many individual depolarization vectors emanating from the atrioventricular (AV) node, which conducts impulses from the atria to the ventricles. These vectors are directed primarily horizontally and vertically, and their net effect is to produce a complex waveform that appears as a series of peaks and valleys on an ECG.

Muscles are specialized tissues that allow animals to move around. They are composed of long fibers, called sarcomeres, which run parallel to each other and are surrounded by fluid-filled spaces called sarcoplasmic reticulum.

It states that as the ventricles become more full, the sarcomeres in the heart muscle become longer and stronger, leading to increased contractility. The relationship is curved, with increased stroke volume at lower end-diastolic volumes and higher stroke volume at higher end-diastolic volumes. The Cardiac Length Tension Relationship describes the tension developed during contraction as depending on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin. The length of the overlapping section between actin and myosin filaments determines the number of myosin heads that bind to actin, and thus the tension developed. The length of the sarcomere determines the length of the overlapping section, and therefore the tension developed. The relationship is curved as well, with increased tension developed at shorter sarcomere lengths and higher end-diastolic volumes, and decreased tension developed at longer sarcomere lengths and higher end-diastolic volumes.\\n\\n### Diagram\\nA diagram showing the Frank Starling Law and the Cardiac Length Tension Relationship would include two curves, one representing the Frank Starling relationship and the other representing the Cardiac Length Tension Relationship. Both curves would begin at the bottom left corner of the graph, with the ventricular end-diastolic volume (or sarcomere length) on the x-axis and the stroke volume (or tension/pressure developed during contraction) on the y-axis.

The process of cardiac excitability involves the movement of positive ions such as sodium and calcium through gap junctions and into the cell, raising the membrane potential to a threshold level (around 70 mV) at which point the voltage-gated sodium channels open and lots of sodium ions rush into the cell causing depolarization.

This is followed by a plateau, then repolarization during which the sodium channels close and become inactivated. Most of the action potential occurs during the absolute refractory period when the majority of the sodium channels are inactivated, making the cell unable to depolarize again. However, some channels begin to recover during the relative refractory period and the cell becomes more excitable. The supranormal period occurs when the cell is more excitable than usual due to the complete recovery of the sodium channels.'],\n",

The process of cardiac excitability involves the movement of positive ions such as sodium and calcium through gap junctions and into the cell, raising the membrane potential to a threshold level (around 70 mV), followed by the opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels and the influx of Na+ ions, leading to depolarization. The repolarization process involves the closing of the Na+ channels and the recovery of the channels over time. Measuring the absolute refractory period involves delivering a current to a myocardial cell and monitoring its response, with multiple bursts of current delivered at regular intervals. The effective refractory period is identified as the point at which the cell emerges from the absolute refractory period, while the relative refractory period occurs once the absolute refractory period ends and continues until the cell membrane has almost completely repolarized.

The length of the sarcomere is determined by the amount of blood in the ventricles during diastole, and the force of contraction during systole depends on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin. The graph shows the relationship between the sarcomere length/ventricular end-diastolic volume on the x-axis and the tension/pressure developed during contraction on the y-axis. The curve demonstrates that as the ventricles fill with more blood, the sarcomeres stretch and more myosin heads bind to actin, leading to a stronger contraction and increased stroke volume. However, if the ventricles become too full, the myosin and actin become too far apart and fewer myosin heads bind to actin, leading to a weaker contraction and decreased stroke volume.'],\n",

A more excitable cell will have more of these channels in the ready state while a less excitable cell will have most of its channels inactivated. The process of cardiac excitability involves the movement of positive ions such as sodium and calcium through gap junctions and into the cell, raising the membrane potential to a threshold level (around 70 mV) at which point the voltage-gated sodium channels open and lots of sodium ions rush into the cell causing depolarization. This is followed by a plateau, repolarization and recovery of the sodium channels. The absolute refractory period occurs when the majority of the sodium channels are inactivated and the cell cannot depolarize. The relative refractory period follows the absolute refractory period and ends when the cell membrane has almost fully repolarized.

Rhabdomyomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor in infants and children and are benign tumors of the heart that occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis.'],\n",

            "The circulatory system is also called the cardiovascular system, where “cardi” refers to the heart, and “vascular” refers to the blood vessels. So, these are the two key parts: the heart, which pumps blood, and the blood vessels, which carry blood to the body and return it back to the heart again. Ultimately, this is how nutrients like O2, or oxygen, get pushed out to the organs and tissues that need it, and how waste like CO2, or carbon dioxide, which is the main byproduct of cellular respiration, gets removed.The heart is about the size of a person’s fist, which makes sense: a bigger person has a bigger fist and, therefore, a bigger heart.And it’s shaped like a cone, and sits slightly shifted over to the left side, in the mediastinum, which is the middle of the chest cavity, or thorax.It sits on top of the diaphragm, which is the main muscle that helps with breathing, behind the sternum, or breastbone, in front of the vertebral column, squished in between the two lungs, and protected by the ribs.   If you look more closely, you can see that the heart sits inside a sac of fluid that has two walls, called the serous pericardium. The outer layer is called the parietal layer. It gets stuck tightly to another layer called the fibrous pericardium, which is made of tough, dense connective tissue, which holds the heart in place and prevents it from overfilling with blood. The inner layer is called the visceral layer, and it gets stuck tightly to the heart itself, forming the epicardium, or the outer layer of the heart. The cells of the serous pericardium, both the parietal and visceral layer -- secrete a protein-rich fluid that fills the space between those layers and serves as a lubricant for the heart, allowing it to move around a bit with each heartbeat without feeling too much friction. So, moving from the outside to the inside of the heart, after the epicardium, there’s the myocardium, which is the muscular middle layer. This forms the bulk of the heart tissue because those cardiac muscle cells contract and pump blood. In addition to cardiac muscle cells, there are crisscrossing connective tissue fibers, which are made of collagen, that together form the fibrous cardiac skeleton, which helps supports the muscle tissue. The myocardium also has dedicated blood vessels - called coronary vessels - which lay on the outside of the heart and then penetrate into the myocardium to bring blood to that layer because it needs a lot of energy to pump blood. Finally, there’s the innermost layer of the heart, called the endocardium, which is made of a relatively thin layer of endothelium, which is the same layer of cells that line the blood vessels. This endocardium lines the heart chambers and heart valves.  All right, so on the right side of the heart, deoxygenated blood enters either through the top, through a blood vessel called the superior vena cava, or the bottom, through another blood vessel called the inferior vena cava, in the right atrium, where “atrium” means “entryway.”. Both vena cavas are veins, which bring blood towards the heart. There’s also a tiny third opening into the right atrium called the coronary sinus, which collects blood from coronary vessels returning from the myocardium. Now, all of that blood then goes through the first of two atrioventricular valves that separate the atria from the ventricles. This one is called the tricuspid valve, and it allows blood into the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve has three little flaps or ‘cusps’, and each cusp looks kind of like a parachute because it has tiny little strings called chordae tendinae coming off of it that tether the cusp to a small muscle called a papillary muscle. When the heart contracts, that papillary muscle keeps the chordae tendinae taut, and both of these help to prevent regurgitation of blood back into the atrium, allowing it to only flow out next valve.That being said, that contraction pumps the blood out the pulmonary valve which like the tricuspid valve has three cusps and also prevents blood from going backwards - but unlike the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve doesn’t have any of those chordae tendinae. Once it’s past the pulmonary valve, the blood goes into the pulmonary arteries which carry the blood away from the heart to the left and right lung. Just remember that arteries start with “a” and carry blood “away” from the heart. The blood goes from the pulmonary artery into a pulmonary arteriole, which is a bit smaller, and finally into a capillary, which is the smallest. In the lungs, the capillary lines up alongside a small sack of air called an alveolus - and when you have a lot of them they’re called alveoli. Up until now the blood has been loaded with carbon dioxide, which makes the blood look dark red rather than blue, which is how it’s usually drawn, and how we’ll still draw it to stay consistent. Now, at this point in the journey, the carbon dioxide moves from the capillary to the alveolus and oxygen moves from the alveolus to the capillary, giving the blood that nice bright red color.   Now, in the blood, each red blood cell has millions of hemoglobin proteins, and each of these hemoglobins can bind to four oxygen molecules, so each red blood cell can carry millions of oxygen molecules when fully loaded! The oxygen-rich blood moves into a venule and then eventually into a pulmonary vein that dumps the blood into the left atrium. This trip -- from the right ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and back to the left atrium of the heart -- is called the pulmonary circulation.  After entering the left atrium, the blood goes through the second atrioventricular valve, called the mitral valve, into the left ventricle. The mitral valve has only two cusps or leaflets, one in front called the anterior leaflet that’s a little smaller and one behind it called the posterior leaflet. Both of these have chordae tendinae coming off of them that tether the valve to papillary muscles in the left ventricle. Similar to the right side of the heart, when it contracts, this prevents blood from going backwards.   Finally, blood in the left ventricle gets pumped out through the aortic valve, which normally has three cusps, out to the aorta, the largest artery in the body. Just like in the lungs, the aorta branches into arterioles which are smaller arteries and finally into capillaries which are the smallest, and at that point they’re at the organs and tissues. In the organs, the red blood cells line up alongside tissue cells and drop off oxygen and pick up carbon dioxide, basically the reverse of what happened with the alveolus in the lung. Loaded up with carbon dioxide, the blood turns that dark red color again, shown as blue, and starts the return journey to the heart by going into small venules and then larger veins. Now, the lower half of the body drains into the inferior vena cava, and the upper half drains into the superior vena cava, both of which dump blood back into the right atrium.   So this trip -- from the left ventricle of the heart to the body and back to the right atrium of the heart -- is called the systemic circulation. Now, relative to the pulmonary circulation, the systemic has a lot more blood vessels, which means there’s about a 5 times greater resistance to blood flow, which essentially meaning it’s a lot harder to pump blood through, even though it’s the same amount of blood being pumped as the pulmonary side. Because of this difference, the left ventricle needs to be stronger, and so the muscular layer of the left ventricle wall - or its myocardium - is three times thicker than the right ventricle’s myocardium.   Okay so let’s talk a little bit about that pumping. Every heartbeat, sounds something like, “lub dub, lub dub, lub dub.” So the first heart sound - “lub”, is called S1, and the noise comes from the tricuspid and mitral valves snapping shut when the left and right ventricles contract which happens at about the same time. Right after the S1 sound, the aortic valve and pulmonic valve open up, allowing blood to get pushed out to the body, and this period of time is called systole. The second heart sound - “dub”, is called S2, and the noise comes from the aortic and pulmonic valves snapping shut to prevent blood from flowing backwards after it leaves the ventricles - effectively ending systole. Right after the S2 sound, the tricuspid and mitral valves open back up, allowing blood to fill up the ventricles again, and this period of time is called diastole. That’s it, each heartbeat can be broken into systole and diastole. So a systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the ventricles are squeezing out blood under high pressure, and diastolic blood pressure is when the ventricles are filling up with more blood, so it’s going to be slightly lower pressure.   Alright so if we simplify this guy a bit, then the amount of blood that is pumped out by either ventricle over a period of time is called the cardiac output. And the rate at which the veins return blood back to the atria is called venous return -- pretty easy to remember, right? Since the circulatory system is a closed loop, cardiac output and venous are equal.   Okay so let’s use some numbers to make this a little more concrete. Let’s say that about 70ml is ejected per squeeze, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute or 70 squeezes per minute. Then 70 x 70 is 4900ml per minute, which in liters is 4.9 L per minute. Meaning this heart’s pumping abut 4.9 L per minute.  Now, in an average adult there’s about 5 L of blood total in the body, which just to be clear is different from the cardiac output we just found, which was the amount pumped per minute. Now, taking this total volume, 10% of that (or about 0.5 ml) is in the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins which make up the pulmonic circulation, and 5% (or .25L) is in one of the four chambers of the heart itself.   Another 15% (or 750 ml) is in the systemic arteries, travelling away from the heart, 5% (or 250 ml) is in the systemic capillaries, and the remaining 65% (or 3.25 L) is in the systemic veins returning to the heart. Now, in terms of where all of that systemic arterial blood goes - about 15% goes to the brain, 5% nourishes the heart itself, 25% goes to the kidneys, another 25% goes to the gastrointestinal organs, yet another 25% goes to the skeletal muscles, and the the last 5% goes to the skin. These numbers can change, for example during exercise, but it gives you a general sense of things.   Alright so that was the systemic arterial blood, but you’ll notice that there’s a lot more blood in the systemic veins, with that being said, arteries are generally lower volume while also being under much higher pressure. In contrast, veins are high volume, low pressure vessels. This explains why arteries and veins have different structures. For example, veins often have valves to help fight gravity and keep blood flowing in one direction back to the heart, whereas arteries don’t need these valves because they’re under higher pressure.  If we take a closer look at blood vessels, they have three layers, also called “tunics,” or coverings, that surround the vessel lumen, which is the hollow part of the vessel that contains the blood. The innermost tunic is the tunica intima, which includes the endothelial cells which create a slick surface that minimizes friction for blood moving through. Next, there’s the tunica media, or middle tunic, which is mostly made of smooth muscle cells and of sheets of elastin protein. Both the cells of the tunica intima and tunica media generally get the nutrients they need from the blood in the lumen. Finally, there’s the tunica externa, or outside tunic, which is made up of loosely woven fibers of collagen protein that protect and reinforce the blood vessel and anchor it in place. The tunica externa also has nerve fibers, lymphatic vessels, and, in the biggest vessels, the protein elastin. To make things really wild, some huge vessels have a tunica externa that is so thick that it needs its own blood supply! So there are tiny blood vessels, called the vasa vasorum, which means “vessels of the vessels,” that creep along the tunica externa to bring nutrients to that layer of the blood vessel wall.  So largest arteries closest to the heart, which are the aorta, its main branches, and the pulmonary arteries -- have so much elastin in their tunica externa and media that they’re called the elastic arteries. These guys are really stretchy -- kinda like spandex -- and this is what allows these arteries to keep their shape as well as absorb and even out the systolic and diastolic pressures. These arteries eventually branch into the arterioles, the smallest of the arteries. In the arterioles, the tunica media is bulky, and can contract in response to hormones and the autonomic nervous system, which is called vasoconstriction, where the lumen gets a lot smaller, which decreases the blood to a capillary bed and ultimately organ or tissue. Also these vessels can relax, or vasodilate and the lumen’s diameter increases, which allows more blood flow. This process can also help with temperature control, or thermoregulation, because blood carries a lot of heat and when it gets near the surface of the skin, more of that heat is lost. So with vasodilation of arterioles, more heat’s lost, which therefore helps to lower body temperature, likewise if you wanted to raise body temperature, vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, which means less heat gets lost through the surface of the skin.  Finally, the capillary walls are generally only one cell thick - just the tunica intima layer, with some larger vessels that also have a subendothelium basement membrane layer, which is a layer of protein just outside of the endothelial cells that provides extra support. In addition to allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to flow back and forth, capillaries are also where nutrients like glucose can get delivered, and where fluid can move out of the blood vessel and into the interstitial space - which is the space between the blood vessels and cells. Water-soluble substances, like ions, cross the capillary wall either through water-filled spaces, called clefts, between the endothelial cells, or through large pores in the walls of fenestrated capillaries. Meanwhile, lipid-, or fat-soluble, molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide can dissolve and then diffuse across the endothelial cell membranes.   On the other end of the capillary bed, there’s a venule, and the arteriole and venule are usually directly connected by a vessel called the metarteriole.\n",

            "“Lymph” means “clear water” in Latin, and it describes the fluid that flows through the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes which make up the lymphatic system. The three major roles of the lymphatic system - the reason we need it in the first place - are that it returns fluid from the tissues back to the heart, it helps large molecules like hormones and lipids enter the blood, and it helps with immune surveillance to keep infections from running amok.So, let’s take a closer look at lymph and where it comes from. The blood in the arteries is under a lot of pressure because it needs to reach every little nook and cranny of the body. The arteries branch out into narrower and narrower arteries, and then arterioles, and finally gets to the capillaries - which have walls that are only one cell thick and are slightly porous. Red blood cells are too big to fit through capillary pores, but small proteins like albumin and fluid can make it through. Every day 20 liters of fluid water and protein - seep out of the capillaries and becomes part of the interstitial fluid between cells. About 17 liters gets quickly reabsorbed right back into the capillaries,but that leaves 3 liters of fluid behind in the tissues each day. This 3 liters of fluid needs to find a way back into the blood so that the body’s interstitial fluid volume and blood volume both stay constant over time. That’s where the lymphatic vessels, or lymphatics, come in: they collect excess interstitial fluid and return it to the blood. Once the interstitial fluid is in the lymphatic vessels, it’s called lymph. Now - you may be wondering how there can be 20 liters of fluid seeping out each day if the blood volume is only 5 liters, but remember that the 5 liters is constantly in motion and that it gets recycled over and over in a single day. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system isn’t a closed loop because fluid and proteins make their way into the microscopic lymphatic capillaries, and all of the collected lymph is dumped into the veins. Lymphatic capillaries are the smallest lymphatic vessels, and they’re located throughout the interstitial space. Lymphatic capillaries are extremely permeable because their walls are made of endothelial cells that only loosely overlap, forming one-way minivalves. These endothelial cells are anchored to structures in the interstitial space by collagen filaments, which allows the lymphatic capillaries to remain flexible but retain their overall shape. When the pressure in the interstitial space is greater than the pressure in the lymphatic capillary, the endothelial minivalves open up, allowing fluid to enter. When the pressure in the interstitial space is less than the pressure in the lymphatic capillary, the endothelial minivalves are pushed shut, keeping the lymph inside. Once the lymph is inside the lymphatic capillaries, it travels through bigger and thicker-walled vessels, then trunks, and then ducts. There’s no pump pushing the lymph through the lymphatic system; instead, smooth muscle in the lymph vessels reacts to the pulsing of nearby arteries by squeezing to get things started, and then the squeezing of skeletal muscles, which normally contract throughout the day, exert external pressure to keep the lymph moving along eventually reaching a nearby lymphatic trunk. To keep the lymph from sliding backwards, the lymphatic vessels have valves just like the veins. The lymphatic trunks are named after the regions of the body that they drain the lymph from: two lumbar trunks, two bronchomediastinal trunks, two subclavian trunks, and two jugular trunks, as well as one intestinal trunk. From there, the lymph is delivered to either the right lymphatic duct which collects lymph from the right arm and the right side of the head and chest, or the thoracic duct, which is much bigger and collects lymph from the rest of the body. The right lymphatic duct dumps lymph into the junction of the right jugular vein and the right subclavian vein, and the thoracic duct dumps lymph into the same junction on the left side of the body. That particular spot is perfect because it’s where the pressure is very low, making it much easier for the lymph to flow in. The lymphatic system has key advantages: for example it can pick up larger molecules, like hormones, that are too large to get into the capillaries, and get them into the bloodstream. The lymphatic system can also help get nutrients to the tissues. For example, during a meal, fatty acids get packaged into balls of fat called chylomicrons by the small intestine. But like the hormones, these are too large to move across capillaries. Instead, the chylomicrons go into special lymphatic vessels called lacteals, which get their name from the fact that the lymph that flows through them looks like milk. The chylomicrons slowly make their way up into the thoracic duct and get dumped into the venous blood. The lymphatic system also plays an important role in immune function. Lymphoid organs remove foreign material from the lymph to keep it from entering the bloodstream, and act as lookout points for the body’s immune defenses. Some lymphoid organs are in the form of diffuse lymphoid tissue, where they are just a loose arrangement of lymphoid cells and protein, this is typical in the lining of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. Another type of lymphoid organ are lymph nodes, which are tightly packed balls of lymphoid cells and protein. Hundreds of lymph nodes cluster along the lymph vessels, each one a few millimeters to about 1–2 cm in size. When they’re concentrated along the lymph trunks, you can feel them, especially in the neck, armpit, and groin. They can also be found in the intestinal wall, where they’re called Peyer’s patches. When an infection gets into the tissue, it can slip into a lymphatic capillary and move into a lymphatic vessel. Unfiltered lymph fluid drains into a nearby lymph node where any pathogen or piece of pathogen is quickly detected by a dendritic cell - a type of antigen-presenting cell that serves up pieces of anything in destroys to other immune cells. In the lymph nodes, dendritic cells continuously sample the lymph and present antigens that they come across to the B cells which are a type of lymphocyte that can make antibodies. B cells are designed to only react to foreign antigens, and if the dendritic cell presents something foreign, the B cell turns into a plasma cells and starting cranking out antibodies which flow into the lymph exiting the lymph node. There are also circulating T cells, which are another type of lymphocyte that move between the lymph nodes, lymph, and blood on the lookout for pathogens and infected or abnormal cells that have been tagged by antibodies.Another lymphoid organ is the spleen, which is about the size of a fist, and sits on the left side of the body below the diaphragm and on top of the stomach. The spleen has both white pulp and red pulp. The white pulp is where antibody-coated bacteria are filtered out of circulation and antibodies are generated by B cells. In a sense, the white pulp of the spleen is like a giant lymph node, although unlike a lymph node which receives unfiltered lymphatic fluid, the spleen receives blood. The red pulp of the spleen is where old and defective blood cells are destroyed and their parts - the hemoglobin, the heme chain, and the iron - are either broken down or recycled. The spleen is also a helpful in that it keeps a red blood cells and platelets available in case they are suddenly needed by the body. An organ that’s got your back in an emergency.Another lymphoid organ is the thymus, which is in the upper part of the chest - just below where a necklace might lie. The thymus is most active in the neonatal period and pre-adolescent years, and then slowly atrophies and gets replaced by fat after puberty. The thymus is involved in the development of T cells - making sure that any T cells that react to self-antigens, antigens that are normally found in the body, are promptly destroyed. A final set of lymphoid organs worth mentioning are the tonsils, which include the adenoid, tubal tonsils, palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils. Together they form a ring of lymphoid tissue around the throat, and their main job is to trap pathogens from the food you eat and air you inhale.\n",

            "Pressure is a force over an area, so with blood pressure, we’re measuring the force that the blood exerts on the surface area of the walls of the blood vessels. Differences in blood pressure throughout the body keep blood flowing from high-pressure areas, like the arteries, to low-pressure areas, like the veins. When we say “blood flow,” we’re referring to the volume of blood that flows through a vessel or an organ over some period of time. Now, the amount of blood flow from one end of a blood vessel to another is affected by the blood pressure, and by the resistance, which comes from the vessels themselves. Vasoconstriction, where the vessels constrict, decreases blood flow, and vasodilation, where the blood vessels expand, increases blood flow.   Now, blood flow is not the same thing as the velocity of blood. Blood flow is the volume of blood that moves by a point over some period of time. So let’s say this chunk of blood has a volume of 83 cm^3, and it took 1 second for this much to flow past the blue circle—this is the blood flow, represented by the variable capital Q.   Now, velocity on the other hand, is the distance traveled in a certain amount of time. So maybe in the same one second, a red blood cell at the very edge here traveled a distance of 27 cm, then it’d be moving 27 cm/s, represented by lowercase v. Even though these aren’t equal, they are related, and the last piece is area, specifically the cross-sectional area of the blood vessel, which in reality is the same as the blood cross section like this. So, based on units, since area’s going to be expressed in cm^2, we see that flow rate equals area times velocity! Alright, so for example, let’s say we want to calculate blood velocity, and we have a person’s cardiac output of 5L/min, which is average for an adult, and the diameter of their aorta, which is 2cm.  First off, using the equation for the area of a circle, (D/2)^2 x pi, we get (2 / 2)^2 x pi = 3.14 cm^2. Next, since cardiac output is the same as blood flow, we just need to convert this L/min to cubic cm per second, so there are 1000 cubic cm in a L, and 60 seconds in a minute, so multiplying those out we get 83 cubic cm per second. Then, rearranging our little formula, velocity equals flow rate divided by area, and we get about 26 cm per second! Which is also about 1 km / hr!  Going back to blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance, that relationship can be written out mathematically as well. So, to start, you have an initial, higher pressure at one end, and a final, lower pressure at the other. The difference between these, or the initial minus the final pressure, sometimes expressed as delta P, equals blood flow through that vessel multiplied by resistance. This can be also written as Q equals change in pressure over resistance. So, for example, let’s say the the blood vessel narrows, which increases the resistance, in order to keep the flow of blood to organs the same, the pressure difference has to increase, and this is typically what happens. This equation might look familiar to a similar equation, where change in voltage V equals current I times resistance R, also known as ohm’s law!   Okay, let’s talk about pressure. Blood pressure is usually highest in a large artery like the brachial artery, which is where blood pressure is usually measured, That’s because at that point the blood still needs to be able to push through the smaller arterioles and capillaries, which means lots of resistance. In an average adult, blood pressure is about 120/80 mmHg or millimeters of mercury. That might look like a fraction, but it’s not. The first number, 120, is the systolic pressure, which is the force that the blood exerts on the walls of the arteries during systole, when the heart contracts to pump blood through the body, and the second number, 80, is the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure on the walls of the arteries during diastole, when the heart relaxes and refills with blood between heartbeats. That’s why the first number is bigger: the arteries are under more pressure when there’s more force from the heart pushing the blood.  The mean arterial pressure, or MAP, is the average pressure on the arteries during a complete cardiac cycle, including the systolic and diastolic pressures. It can be calculated a couple ways. The first is the quickest: we assume that about ⅓ of the cardiac cycle is spent in systole and about ⅔ of the cardiac cycle is spent in diastole and say that the MAP = ⅓ (systolic blood pressure) + ⅔ (diastolic blood pressure). Another measuremnt is the pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure, so in our example, it would be 120 - 80 or 40 mm Hg. So another way to figure it out is to say that MAP = ⅓ (pulse pressure) + diastolic pressure, which is exactly the same thing, but just written differently.   Now, a completely different way to think about MAP is by using the relationship between blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance. Let’s go back to our big artery, say this time it’s the aorta, the biggest of the arteries coming right from the heart itself. That artery goes to arterioles and capillaries, representing the whole human body, and then the venous blood returns to the right atrium of the heart. So in this zoomed out view, the initial pressure here is pressure in the arteries, in other words—the mean arterial pressure, and the final pressure over here is we have the central venous pressure, or CVP, in the vena cavae right before they enter the right atrium.   Looking back at our equation, Pi - Pf = Q x R, blood flow is the total blood flow through all of the blood vessels and organs, which is called the cardiac output and is measured in L/min. Pi is MAP and Pf is CVP, and finally, the combined resistance of all of the blood vessels of systemic circulation would be the systemic vascular resistance, called SVR,. So the equation is MAP - CVP = CO x SVR. CVP is usually a small number, so it’s usually ignored and the equation is simplified to MAP = CO x SVR. Based on this relationship, you can see why for example, an increase in resistance, which is mostly caused by arteriole vasoconstriction, will cause the blood pressure to rise.\n",

            "When we talk about pressures in the cardiovascular system, we’re talking about blood pressure. Pressures in different parts of the cardiovascular system aren’t equal and these differences in pressures keep the blood moving from high pressure areas leaving the heart like the arteries to low pressure areas like the veins. Actually, the pressure curve looks a little more like this, and fluctuates in the arteries depending on part of the cardiac cycle it’s in, with these peaks being systole, and these low points being diastole -That being said, this original line is the average of these fluctuations, or the mean arterial pressure. Now, since systole takes up about a third of a single cardiac cycle, and diastole takes up the remaining 2/3 of the cycle, we can calculate the mean arterial pressure at any time by the equation:                                MAP = (⅓) SBP + (⅔) DBPWhich after distributing we get:                                MAP = DBP + (⅓) PPNow, looking at these fluctuations on the arterial side, there’s a couple important things to notice. First of all, on the downswing of the curve, there’s a sharp sharp pressure drop followed by a rise again forming what’s called the dicrotic notch or incisura. As blood is ejected out into the aorta, pressure rises quickly, and then as a tiny amount of blood flows back into the ventricle, and causes the valve to snap shut and the pressure to fall. That snapping shut of the valve causes it to recoil back, which causes a brief increase in pressure of aorta, and then finally the pressure falls as the aorta settles and the heart relaxes.A second interesting thing to notice is that the pulse pressure in the large arteries downstream of the aorta is larger than those in the aorta themselves!That’s because the pressure from blood travels a bit faster than blood itself. To understand that idea - think of the molecules and cells in the blood like Newton’s cradle, and while they move together, they bump into each other and transmit that pressure wave faster than the group can move as a whole, meaning that the pressure wave actually increases the pressure downstream. Also, the pressure waves bounce off the branch points in the arteries, which causes them to reflect back and increase the pressure in the arteries even more.Alright, so it should seem a little weird that both systolic pressure and pulse pressure are higher in the downstream arteries, since we know that blood wants to move from a high pressure area to a low pressure area, but one thing to remember is that in the large arteries the diastolic pressure is lower, and remember that it’s the mean arterial pressure that drives blood flow, which this is mostly affected by diastolic pressure, which is highest in the aorta. As an example, let’s say the aorta’s SBP is 115 and DBP is 85, meaning PP is 30. That said, the MAP is 95 mmHg. Now, if the large arteries’ SBP is 120 and DBP is 80, with a PP of 40, the MAP ends up being 93, which is lower than in the aorta like we’d expect! Okay, so as we move out from the arterial tree, the pressure gets lower and lower as the arteries branch out into smaller and smaller arteries and then arterioles and then capillaries. As the blood move across the arterioles the pressure falls from about 80 mmHg to 30 mmHg. As the vessels branch into smaller and smaller arterioles, resistance goes up, and since resistance goes up, and according to the equation flow rate equals change in pressure or pressure initial minus pressure final, divided by resistance, with increased resistance, the pressure final or downstream pressure must decreases, which increases the change in pressure and keeps flow rate constant. Across the capillaries, the pressure drops from 30 mmHg down to about 10 mmHg. So the pressure drop is greater across the arterioles then the capillaries, even though capillaries are even smaller, which means even more resistance. The pressure drop is less, though, because there are so many capillaries that run in parallel to one another, that it helps to reduce total resistance, since total resistance for vessels in parallel is less than the resistance in any individual vessel. After the capillaries, blood goes into the venules and then the larger veins. At this point, the pressure drops aren’t great because the blood vessels have a larger and larger radius and have a high compliance and can expand to hold more blood.Finally blood makes it to the vena cavae, and pressure is roughly 4 mmHg and right atrial pressure is around 2 mmHg. Even though there are only small differences in pressure, it’s enough to move blood back to the heart, even when it’s going against gravity. Various clinical situations can cause pressures in the system to go up or down, and that affects all of the downstream pressures as well. As an example, let’s take a closer look at the normal aortic pressure curve, and then two situations that often alter aortic pressures. The first is arteriosclerosis, which is a chronic condition where the arteries become stiff and less compliant, a bit like a rubber hose turning into a lead pipe over time. The baseline diastolic pressure usually doesn’t change, but the extra volume of blood that exerts pressure on the walls during systole, results in enormous increases in systolic pressure because the walls are so stiff. The high systolic pressure with the unchanged diastolic pressure means that there is also an increased pulse pressure and therefore an increased mean arterial pressure. The second example is aortic stenosis - a narrowing of the aortic valve which increases it’s resistance. With increased resistance, the change in pressure must increase, which means there’s a decrease in pressure after the valve. The diastolic pressure remains unchanged, but there’s a decrease systolic pressure, decreased pulse pressure, and decreased mean arterial pressure. Alright, so this whole bit we just talked about is the systemic circulation, but once the blood gets the right atrium it enters the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation. So here in the pulmonary arteries, the pressure is 25 mm Hg during systole and 8 mm Hg during diastole, which means that the mean arterial pressure in the pulmonary artery is 25 (⅓) + 8 (⅔) = 14 mm Hg. That pressure drops to 10 mm Hg in the capillaries, to 8 mm Hg in the pulmonary vein, then to 2-5 mm Hg in the left atrium.\n",

            "Laminar means smooth, and so laminar blood flow is blood that’s flowing smoothly through the vessels. Turbulent flow, on the other hand, is when the blood’s not flowing smoothly, and we can figure out if blood is likely to be laminar or turbulent by finding its Reynolds number or Re, which is named after Osborne Reynolds, a Victorian scientist who not only studied fluid dynamics, but is a man that knows how to rock a beard and bowtie.If everything’s moving like it should and the blood flow is laminar, the linear velocity of the blood  -- how fast it’s moving in a straight line -- is greatest in the center of the blood vessel, and lowest near the walls of the vessel, dropping to zero at the wall. Sometimes, though, blood flow is disrupted, like if it has to pass by a crusty old atherosclerotic plaque along the wall, which reduces the diameter of the blood vessel at that point and causes turbulence. There are a number of factors help predict turbulence, they include the density of the blood, usually denoted by the greek letter rho, the viscosity denoted by the greek letter nu. You can kind of think of a fluid’s viscosity as it’s thickness, like for example the viscosity of honey is greater than that of water. Alright, then there’s velocity of blood flow (v), and the diameter of the blood vessel (d)These values can all be used to come up with a single value—the reynold’s number, often denoted Re, and the equation looks like this: NR = pdv/Generally speaking, if the Reynolds number is low - below 2000, then blood flow will be laminar - think “low” and “laminar”, and if the Reynolds number is above 3000 it’ll be turbulent. A Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 is somewhere in between. As a real-life example, a person with anemia has a low red blood cell count, and in general has a lower hematocrit, the ratio of red blood cells to total blood volume. This essentially means the blood’s less thick or viscous, which means based on our equation, if viscosity decreases, reynolds number increases. Also, these individuals often have an increased cardiac output, which means increased blood velocity and therefore increased reynolds number.Another example would be a person with a thrombus, or blood clot, which just like the atherosclerotic plaque would narrow or decrease the diameter of the blood vessel...now, at first glance this seems a little weird eh? But it turns out that blood velocity also depends on the diameter of the vessel, by the equation velocity equals flow rate over area, which after subbing for the area of the blood vessel, is 4Q over pi d^2, so plugging that in for velocity, we see that as diameter decreases, reynolds number increases!Now a related concept is shear. Now, remember how the velocity of the blood depended on whether it was in the center or near the walls? Where it’s fastest in the middle and really slow near the walls, in fact at the molecular level, just outside the walls, water molecules are just sort of loitering around not moving! If we freeze it and plot these velocities, we’ll notice that this difference in velocity is parabolic, meaning that as you move away from the walls, velocity at first jumps up pretty quick, but as you near the middle, the change in velocity is pretty low. This difference in relative velocities is the shear! So if we wanted to plot shear, near the wall where velocity’s changing the most, shear’s actually the highest, and in the middle shear is very low and actually drops to zero.Shear goes hand-in-hand with viscosity, because the higher the shear, the lower the viscosity of the blood. This is because shear helps to pull the elements in the blood apart decreasing it's stickiness, or viscosity, making blood less viscous at the vessel walls and more viscous in the middle of the vessel.Now, let’s say all the blood’s somehow moving at the same velocity. Well in that case, if you plot it out, there’s no change in velocity across the blood vessel, and that makes plotting shear pretty easy...since there’s no change in velocity there’s no shear, and likewise this fluid isn’t viscous!\n",

            "Blood flow refers to the volume of blood travelling through a blood vessel, an organ, or the entire body over a period of time, and it can be measured as liters per minute. As blood flows, it encounters various factors that resist flow and movement of blood, known as the vascular resistance.The first factor to contribute to vascular resistance is blood viscosity, where you can think of viscosity as the fluid’s thickness, or how sticky it is. The relationship is directly proportional, which can be represented as resistance ∝ η which is the greek letter eta and represents viscosity. So this means that as viscosity goes up, it’s harder it is for the liquid’s molecules to slide past each other, and the resistance goes up. Think about a heaping stack o’ pancakes, then picture some maple syrup. Even on flipping the syrup upside down it doesn’t really come out right away and resists moving right away; slowly it gloops out and doesn’t splash but just coats those pancakes in a delicious film of sugary goodness, oh right. Now, with another stack, grab some orange juice and pour...it immediately comes out and pretty goes everywhere. This is because the the juice is less viscous than the syrup, so there’s going to be less resistance to movement. Because blood is full of large proteins and cells, it’s pretty viscous and moves much more slowly than just plain water, or orange juice. Blood viscosity doesn’t change much over time, but certain conditions like polycythemia, where the person has too many red blood cells, can increase viscosity, and conditions like anemia, where the person doesn’t have enough red blood cells, can decrease viscosity.A second factor that affects resistance is total blood vessel length. Just like with viscosity, the relationship is directly proportional, and this can be represented as resistance ∝ L, so, simply put, shorter vessels have less resistance and longer vessels have more resistance because there’s more friction resisting flow. This means that as a child grows into an adult, their blood vessels will get longer, and their peripheral resistance will go up.A third factor that affects resistance is blood vessel radius, which in this case is inversely proportional to resistance...to the fourth power! Meaning that that as a vessel’s radius goes down, its resistance really goes up. Unlike viscosity and length, the radius can change from minute to minute, especially the radius of arterioles, which can vasoconstrict like when you’re lying at home on the couch, which would decrease diameter and increase resistance, or vasodilate like when you’re running outside playing frisbee, which would increase diameter and decrease resistance.Now, the equation relating all these variables is resistance R is equal to 8 times viscosity eta times length L divided by pi times radius r to the fourth power.Now keep in mind that resistance is also related to blood pressure and blood flow by the relationship: Q = . So let’s apply this to a real-life situation, let’s say a person has a blood flow of 300 ml/min going through their carotid artery and they suddenly develop a blockage of exactly half of the artery, which can happen in a stroke, what would happen to the blood flow? Well, a 50% blockage means that the radius is now ½ of what it was, and looking at our equation, since nothing else has changed, plugging in 1/2r for our original r, we get ½ r to the fourth or 1/16 r, meaning resistance goes up by 16 times! iAssuming that the blood pressure doesn’t change right away, subbing in this new 16 times greater resistance, we see that the blood flow drops by 16 times,i from 300 ml/min to 300 ml/min / 16 = 19 ml/min, which is a huge drop!So that’s how resistance works for a single vessel. Now, what if you have a bunch of different sized vessels in a row, each with their own resistance, and you wanted to figure out the total resistance? Well since, they’re in a row one after another, we say they’re in series, and you simply add the individual resistances all together to get a total resistance. That’s called the serial resistance. As an example, let’s think about blood heading out to a cell in your toe and back. After leaving your heart, It has to go through an artery, then through an arteriole, then through a capillary alongside that toe cell, then back through a venule, and finally through a vein to reach the heart. If we add up all of those individual resistances, our total will equal the total resistance faced by the blood flow going to the toe cell and then back to the heart, assuming there are no branches in the system and no other cells to worry about. When we arrange resistance in series like this, the blood flow through each part of the system is the same, but the resistance at each level will differ mostly based on the length and radius of each vessel. So far, so good. Of course, this doesn’t account for the millions of branch points in the circulatory system, and for that we have to think about the concept of parallel resistance. In short, it’s when two vessels branch and move blood in parallel and then meet up again, which is exactly what happens in the circulatory system since there is a lot of branching and ultimately all of the blood meets up again in the right atrium. To calculate the total resistance for these portions where the vessels split, we use1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + etc.So to apply these two equations, let’s say that we want to figure out the total resistance here. In this case we have five different resistances to worry about. Now let’s give these some numbers, Let’s say we’ve got a larger but longer blood vessel with a resistance of 6, and then it branches into three. The very thin blood vessel in the middle has a resistance of 10, and the slightly larger ones on either side both have a resistance of 5. Then all the branches come back together and connect to a short wide vessel with a resistance of 2. Now, these resistances do have units, but for simplicity’s sake I’m not showing them, but in case you’re curious resistance is measured as mmHg・minutes/Liter. To figure out the total resistance we need to break this down into two parts, and we’re going to add up the parallel resistance of the three vessels in the middle first. So that’s ⅕ + 1/10 + ⅕, which is 2/10 + 1/10 + 2/10, which is 5/10, which remember is equal to 1 over R total. So if we flip 1/Rtotal and 5 over 10, we get Rtotal equals 10 over 5 which equals 2. So this is the resistance of this chunk of parallel vessels. That makes sense, because with parallel resistance, the total is always less than the resistance of any one component. Now that we have the combined resistance of the parallel guys, the remaining are just in series, so we just add up 6 + 2 + 2, and that’s 10 or 10 mmHg・minutes/Liter, which just happens to be right around the actual resistance you see in the entire systemic circulation, by comparison, the pulmonary circulation has only 1/10th of that resistance, it’s closer to 1 mmHg・minutes/Liter.It’s also worth mentioning quick that, just like before, the flow through these bits in series is the same, along with the total flow through this whole parallel system. The flow through each of these parallel vessels though, is not the same, since the blood has to split flow through each of the vessels, although, the sum of these three flows must equal the total flow!\n",

            "    **Answer:** Resistance in the circulatory system depends on several factors including blood viscosity, vessel length, and vessel radius. Viscosity is highest in the arteries and lowest in the veins due to differences in protein content. Resistance increases as vessel length increases and decreases as vessel radius increases. Total blood flow is affected by resistance and blood pressure, and a blockage in an artery can greatly reduce blood flow. Serial resistance is calculated by adding the individual resistances of multiple vessels in sequence. Parallel resistance occurs when vessels branch off and reconnect, and is calculated using the formula 1/R\\_total = 1/R\\_1 + 1/R\\_2 +... To determine the total resistance in a complex system, such as the circulatory system, requires considering all the various types of vessels and their associated resistances.\n",

            "Compliance, which is sometimes called capacitance or distensibility, refers to the ability of a vessel to respond to an increase in pressure by to distending or swell and increase the volume of blood it can hold, or with decreased pressure, a decrease in volume. The way that this applies to blood vessels is to remember that they are stretchable tubes like rubber hoses rather than lead pipes. So if the pressure increases, the walls of the tube can actually stretch out a bit to accommodate a larger volume, and exactly how much they stretch out depends on their compliance.We can calculate a given blood vessel’s compliance, C, by dividing the volume of blood, V, in mL by the amount of pressure (P) in mmHg, that the blood is experiencing. And so we measure compliance in mL / mm Hg.So we can plot out volume as a function of pressure, where the slope, volume over pressure, is the compliance. The veins have high compliance, meaning they’re high-volume, low pressure vessels, and even a small increase in pressure expands the volume a loti. The arteries, on the other hand have low compliance, and are low-volume, high pressure vessels, meaning with same amount of pressure, their volume doesn’t expand as much. Furthermore, a hardened artery would be even less compliant, and is like a lead pipe, in other words it takes an incredible amount of pressure to change the volume even a tiny bit.With that in mind, since veins are more compliant, the majority of the blood in the body at any given time is in the veins, whereas less blood is in the thicker, less compliant arteries at any given time. Now, when the arteries harden due to arteriosclerosis, they become even less compliant over time, which means they can’t hold as much blood volume at the same pressure. That volume of blood is going to wind up in the veins. In this situation, blood simply moves away from the even higher pressure arteries to the area of lowest pressure, typically where the compliance is highest, like the veins. Now, if compliance, or volume over pressure, is it’s tendency to stretch out with pressure, than its inverse would be it’s tendency to not stretch, or another way to think about it is its tendency to recoil back to its original shape, which is a concept known as its elastance E. Both of these concepts are super relevant for large elastic arteries like the aorta, which literally comes right off the heart. Now, first off, heart cells take ATP and use that chemical energy to contract during systole, turning it into mechanical energy. This propels blood out into the aorta. Since it’s moving blood, it has kinetic energy, but also since it’s exerting pressure on the walls of the vessel, it also has pressure energy, a form of potential energy, and the sum of these two is equal to the total energy E, which we’ll represent by this little health bar thing, which is filled with kinetic energy in blue and pressure energy in purple. So, let’s just say that during this time that pressure energy corresponds to a pressure of 140 mmHg. After the heart contracts, it relaxes and is filling with blood, called diastole. Now, during this time the blood’s still moving and there’s still pressure, but it’s just much less energy. So the pressure energy drops significantly, let’s say to something that corresponds to 50 mmHg. The difference between these, in this case 90 mmHg, is called the pulse pressure.Okay, but in reality even though the aorta isn’t very compliant, during systole it still stretches out with these high-pressure contractions, some of that volume is held in this distended space, since it’s very elastic, the walls store some of that energy of contraction as elastic energy in the walls, another form of potential energy. Since the total energy has to stay the same, there’s less pressure and kinetic energy to make way for that elastic energy. so less pressure energy means the blood pressure isn’t as high, let’s say 120 mmHg. Now, during diastole, the elastic walls recoil or snap back, moving that blood that was held during systole out into the circulatory system and that stored elastic energy gets converted back to pressure energy and kinetic energy, so now pressure energy gets added, yielding a pressure of say 60 mmHg, which means the new pulse pressure is lower—60 mmHg.So, with elastic arteries, the blood pressures are 120 over 60, with a difference or pulse pressure of 60 mmHg, and remember without the elastic properties, it was 140 / 50 with a pulse pressure of 90. So here we see these large elastic arteries buffer or dampen the pulse pressure, and this whole phenomenon is known as the Windkessel effect!As a person ages, healthy compliant arteries become stiff and non-compliant, resulting in blood vessels that behave more like the non-elastic case, which means pulse pressure ultimately goes up.\n",

            "The main job of the heart is to pump oxygenated blood with nutrients through the arteries to the body’s tissues and receive back deoxygenated blood full of waste products through the veins. Now, let’s zoom into the left ventricle. There’s a moment when the left ventricle is fully relaxed. It occurs at the end of filling or diastole, also called the end-diastolic point, and the volume of blood within the left ventricle is called the end-diastolic volume, and it’s about 120 milliliters. Then the left ventricle contracts, forcing blood through the aorta and into the whole arterial system. After that is another moment when the left ventricle is fully contracted. It occurs at the end of contraction or systole, also called the end-systolic point, and the volume of blood within the left ventricle is called end-systolic volume, and it’s about 50 milliliters. So, end-diastolic volume minus end-systolic volume, gives us the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood that the left ventricle ejects with every heartbeat, or stroke. In this case, the stroke volume is 120 minus 50, which equals 70 milliliters. Stroke volume is a useful measurement, but it can vary based on the size of a person. For example, a stroke volume of 50 milliliters might be absolutely fine for a small person with a small heart volume, but may be low for a large person with a bigger heart volume. So another helpful measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the stroke volume divided by the end-diastolic volume, Ejection fraction = Stroke Volume / End- Diastolic Volume. In a normal individual that’s 70/120, or about 58%, but it can fluctuate between 50 and 65% and still be considered normal. In other words, at least half of the blood volume in the left ventricle should get pumped out during each heartbeat. In hearts that have a low contractility - a low force of contraction - the ejection fraction can fall below 50%.  Every minute, though, our heart beats many times, so if we multiply the stroke volume times the heart rate, or the times our heart beats per minute, we’ll get the cardiac output, which is the total volume of blood the left ventricle ejects in one minute. Using the stroke volume of 70 ml/ beat and a resting heart rate of 70 beats/minute, cardiac output is 4900 ml/min, or 4.9 liters/min. Remember that a normal adult body contains approximately 5 liters of blood, so this means that every last drop of blood travels through the left ventricle at least once every minute! Of course, the heart can adjust it’s heart rate and the stroke volume based on whether you’re sleeping or doing exercise. In fact, trained athletes can have a cardiac output that reaches up to 35 liters/ minute! The cardiac output flows through the arteries and is distributed to the various organs meet their oxygen and nutrient demands. Of all of the organs, the liver receives the largest amount of blood flow. The kidneys also get a lot of blood flow, but less than the liver. However, when correcting for the mass of these tissues, the kidney gets much more blood per gram of tissue than any other organ - and this is called tissue perfusion. So flow refers to the total amount of blood volume going someplace like an organ over time, and perfusion refers to the total amount of blood volume going to a gram of tissue over time.\n",

            "More than a century ago, two physiologists, Otto Frank and Ernest Starling discovered that as the heart gets filled up with more blood during diastole, it contracts harder and pumps out more blood during systole. So they came up with the Frank Starling Law to explain this relationship. To understand this relationship, let’s zoom into the wall of the ventricles. The bulk of these walls is made up of short, branched cardiac muscle cells packed one next to the other. Zooming in further, if we look inside the muscle cells, we see bundles of myofibrils, or long chains of sarcomeres. The sarcomere is the smallest structure in the muscle that is capable of contracting so it's considered the basic contractile unit of the muscle. The sarcomere has two Z discs that form its boundary and a M line in the middle.  Attached to the Z disc are thin filaments made of actin protein. These actin filaments have structural polarity which means both ends of the filament look different.  We can think of it like an arrow with the pointed end being the “minus end,” pointing towards the M line, and the tail end being the “plus end,” attached to the Z disc. Just like an arrow, the actin filament can only move in one direction: the direction it’s pointed at.  Attached to the M line are the myosin filaments which are thick bundles of myosin proteins with two globular heads. During a muscle contraction, the myosin heads grabs onto the actin filaments, and pull them towards the M line which brings the two Z discs closer together.  Overall, the amount of tension developed, or the force of muscle contraction during systole, depends on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin. And this number directly depends on the length of the overlapping section between actin and myosin filaments. The length of the overlapping section depends on the overall length of the sarcomere. And the length of the sarcomere depends on how much blood fills the ventricle during diastole - because that affects how stretched out the overall muscle wall and each sarcomere within it end up being. This relationship is known as the cardiac length-tension relationship and it can be shown by this  graph, with the sarcomere length or the ventricular end- diastolic volume on the x axis and the tension or pressure developed within the ventricle, during their contraction, or systole, on the y axis.So let’s imagine that the ventricles are mostly empty, with almost no blood in them.  This would mean that there’s nothing stretching the muscles in the ventricular wall, so the length of sarcomeres are really short. At this length, the two Z discs are pulled close to each and there’s not much room for further contraction. Furthermore, the actin filaments from each side of the sarcomere crosses the M line and overlap. Since actin can be pulled only in one direction- towards the midline, myosin has to attach and pull the actin filament with the right structural polarity: the one pointing in the same direction as that the myosin pulls. So, when the actin filaments overlap, myosin is prevented from binding to its own actin filament by the actin filament from the other side with the wrong polarity. As a result, very few myosin- actin attachments are made and the cells can contract only very weakly during systole. On the graph, we can see near the point of origin, the short length of myocardial fibers corresponds with a low contractile force. As the ventricles fill with more blood returning through the veins, their walls get more and more stretched and that stretches out every single sarcomere in the muscle cells as well. This means that there’s more space, and no actin overlapping which allows more myosin heads to properly interact with actin and as a result, create more force, or tension, during contraction. Looking at the graph, this would make our curve move steadily upwards with increasing force as there’s increasing volume. This stretching can go on until it exceeds a maximal point, after which things start getting too stretched out. This means the Z discs are so far apart from each other that there’s only little overlap between actin and myosin filaments and actin gets out of reach from myosin. As a result, there's a decreased number of myosin heads that manage to attach to actin and pull it towards the M line.  This leads to a decreased force of contraction, so the curve starts falling off again. Now, that we’ve seen the relationship between length of the sarcomeres and tension during contraction in systole, let’s look at the Frank Starling relationship. This can be also be plotted onto a similar graph, with the ventricular end- diastolic volume on the x axis and the stroke volume, which is the volume of blood pumped out by the ventricle with each heartbeat, on the y axis. So, at the start of the curve, near the bottom left- hand corner, we have a low end diastolic volume meaning very little blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. So sarcomeres are squeezed together with very few myosin heads binding to actin. This results in a weak contraction during systole and a low stroke volume. As the volume of blood returning to the ventricles increases, sarcomeres stretch, and there’s more myosin-actin binding, so a greater strength of the contraction is achieved and stroke volume rises. That’s true until the end- diastolic volume becomes so high, and the myosin and actin get too far apart, the number of myosin and actin binding decreases, resulting in a weaker contraction, so the stroke volume falls off again.Keep in mind though that this curve reflects the heart’s intrinsic ability to vary the strength of contraction based on the volume of blood that it’s filled with.  Within the body, though, there are plenty of extrinsic signals as well like nerve or hormonal stimuli and medications. Some of these signals, like stimulation from the sympathetic nervous system or the medication digoxin, can have a positive inotropic effect on the heart. This means that at a given end- diastolic volume, they increase the strength of contraction, moving the curve upwards and increasing the stroke volume. On the other hand, there are negative inotropic agents, like medications like beta- blockers, that decrease the strength of contraction, moving the curve downwards and decreasing stroke volume.\n",

            "The Frank Starling law explains the relationship between the force of contraction (stroke volume) of the heart and the amount of blood filling the ventricles during diastole. It states that the stronger the contraction, the more blood will be pumped out per beat. The relationship between the force of contraction and the amount of blood filling the ventricles is described by the cardiac length-tension relationship. When the ventricles are nearly empty, the sarcomeres are short and closely spaced, allowing fewer myosin heads to bind to actin, leading to a weak contraction. As the ventricles fill with blood, the sarcomeres stretch and become longer, allowing more myosin heads to bind to actin, leading to a stronger contraction and increased stroke volume. However, beyond a certain level, further stretching causes the Z lines to move too far apart, reducing the number of myosin-actin interactions and weakening the contraction.\n",

Factors such as the density and viscosity of the blood, as well as the velocity of blood flow and the diameter of the blood vessel, can be used to calculate the Reynolds number. Anemia, with its lower red blood cell count and hematocrit, results in a lower Reynolds number due to the reduced viscosity of the blood. Similarly, the presence of a thrombus or blood clot in a blood vessel will increase the Reynolds number due to the reduction in diameter of the vessel. Shear refers to the difference in velocity of the blood between the center and walls of a blood vessel, with higher shear occurring near the walls and lower shear in the middle of the vessel. Higher shear levels lead to lower viscosity of the blood, making it less sticky and easier for the blood to flow.'],\n",

As people age, healthy compliant arteries become stiffer and less compliant, leading to an increase in pulse pressure. Elasticity is related to the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. In the context of arteries, elasticity allows them to store energy during systole and release it during diastole, affecting blood pressure and pulse pressure.'],\n",
              "  7: [\"\\nThe main function of the heart is to circulate oxygenated blood to the body's tissues via the arteries and receive deoxygenated blood with waste products through the veins. This process happens in two stages: diastole (relaxation) and systole (contraction). During diastole, the left ventricle fills with blood up to 120ml, known as end-diastolic volume. At the end of systole, the left ventricle contracts to expel blood through the aorta, leaving behind an end-systolic volume of around 50ml. The difference between these volumes is called the stroke volume, which ranges from 70-120ml in healthy individuals. Another important measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume, typically ranging from 50-65%. These measurements help determine heart function and disease progression. Cardiac output is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate, providing the total volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle in a minute. Normal adults contain roughly 5L of blood, meaning every minute the entire volume passes through the left ventricle. Athletes can achieve high cardiac outputs of up to 35L/min. Blood flow is then distributed to different organs, with the liver receiving the most, followed by the kidneys. Kidney tissue perfusion is highest per gram of tissue compared to other organs.\"],\n",

Additionally, the more blood the ventricles hold during diastole, the more the sarcomeres will stretch, allowing more myosin heads to bind to actin and leading to a stronger contraction and increased stroke volume.

When preload increases, the end-diastolic volume expands, leading to increased stroke work. Conversely, when afterload increases, the end-systolic pressure rises, reducing the stroke volume and stabilizing the stroke work. Contractility influences the duration of the ejection phase, resulting in varying stroke volumes and thus stroke work.\"],\n",

Here\\'s a summary of the information provided:\\n\\nThe human body contains specialized cells called \"pacemaker\" cells located in specific areas of the heart that are responsible for generating the electrical impulses that regulate the heartbeat. These pacemaker cells work together with other types of heart cells (called \"cardiac muscle cells\") to create a functional syncytium that allows the heart to function properly.\\n\\nThe initiation of an action potential in a pacemaker cell is caused by depolarization, which occurs when certain ions (such as sodium) move across the cell membrane.

Different types of ion channels respond to different stimuli (such as changes in the membrane potential), and their presence and behavior help to regulate the flow of ions and therefore the electrical activity of the cell.'],\n",
              "  12: ['\\nThe cardiac excitability refers to the ability of myocytes or myocardial cells to be depolarized or generate an action potential. This process is influenced by the presence of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, which determine whether or not the cell will depolarize based on their readiness. A more excitable cell will have more of these channels in the ready state, while a less excitable cell will have most of them inactivated. The process of depolarization involves a series of events including the entry of positive ions such as sodium and calcium through gap junctions, followed by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a surge of Na+ ions into the cell and resulting in depolarization. After the upstroke, the channels become inactivated, remaining closed and unavailable for another depolarization until they recover during the repolarization phase. There are three phases of the action potential: the upstroke, the plateau, the repolarization, and the refractory periods. The absolute refractory period occurs when all of the sodium channels are inactivated, preventing further depolarizations. The effective refractory period occurs when the cell has emerged from the absolute refractory period but is still not fully excitable. The relative refractory period follows, with some of the sodium channels having recovered and becoming available for another depolarization. The final stage is the supranormal period, where the cell is more excitable than usual due to the recovery of all sodium channels.'],\n",

Cardiomyocytes are connected by gap junctions and held together by desmosomes. They have T-tubules, which increase their surface area, and sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores intracellular calcium. When a cardiomyocyte depolarizes, calcium ions move from one cell to another via gap junctions and trigger further depolarizations. The presence of T-tubules helps bring calcium deeper into the cell, where it binds to ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and releases more calcium into the cell, leading to activation of myofilaments and cell contraction. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and expose actin binding sites, allowing myosin heads to bind and pull actin filaments past each other. The process uses ATP and eventually returns the calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.'],\n",

Alterations to the heart's overall QRS vector, such as those caused by scar tissue from a myocardial infarction or thickening of the muscle wall due to hypertrophy, can move the QRS transition zone.

High blood pressure triggers the former, while low blood volume triggers the latter. Both types fire neural impulses to the brainstem's cardiovascular centers, which then send signals to either constrict blood vessels and slow down the heart rate (lowering blood pressure), or relax blood vessels and speed up the heart rate (raising blood pressure).\"],\n",

Peripheral chemoreceptors sense changes in the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood vessels and transmit signals to the brainstem to adjust the activity of the vasomotor and cardiovascular centers. The vasomotor center controls the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, limiting blood flow to peripheral organs and increasing venous return to the heart. Meanwhile, the cardiac accelerator center is inhibited, reducing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart. Airway and breathing are regulated through the integration of inputs from both peripheral and central chemoreceptors. Central chemoreceptors monitor the levels of carbon dioxide and pH in the cerebrospinal fluid and trigger the respiratory centers to increase respiratory drive when necessary. They also respond to changes in blood flow to the brain, leading to the Cushing reaction, which increases blood pressure to maintain adequate perfusion of the brain.'],\n",

It occurs when one of the vessels supplying blood to the heart gets blocked, leading to death of heart muscle. There's two types of MI, NSTEMI and STEMI. NSTEMI doesn't show up on an ECG as well as STEMI does, and it's caused by partial infarct of the wall. STEMI has ST-segment elevation on ECG and involves the whole wall thickness. Signs and symptoms include severe and crushing chest pain or pressure, maybe radiation to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, nausea, fatigue, and dyspnea. Labs can confirm with high sensitivity troponin I, Troponin T, and CK-MB. Risk of arrhythmias is high immediately following an MI. Depending on how much contractile tissue is affected, patients might develop cardiogenic shock. Pericarditis and inflammation can occur in the days following an infarction. Healing process takes weeks to months and results in granulation tissue. Complications include heart failure. Fibrinolytic therapy, angioplasty, and PCI may be performed to restore blood flow.

They're divided into two categories: alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and methyldopa. Examples of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla, to decrease the release of norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, resulting in lower blood pressure. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients benefit from these medications because alpha-2 receptor agonists, particularly clonidine, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors present in the prefrontal cortex to moderate the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain, tuning out irrelevant stimuli and sharpening focus. However, the most common side effects are orthostatic hypotension and rebound hypertension upon sudden discontinuation. Methyldopa is another central anti-adrenergic medication that works differently. It looks like L-DOPA and fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine, which can’t be broken down by monoamine oxidases. Built-up methyldopamine then circles back to act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neuron membrane, leading to further inhibition of norepinephrine release. Methyldopa is safe for pregnant women and can be used to lower blood pressure. Side effects include liver toxicity, allergic reactions, and hemolytic reactions.

This process is influenced by the presence of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, which can be either excitable or less excitable depending on their readiness. When enough positive ions (such as sodium and calcium) enter the cell through gap junctions, the voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing a large influx of sodium ions that leads to depolarization. After the upstroke of the action potential, the sodium channels close and become inactivated, making the cell refractory to further depolarizations for a period known as the absolute refractory period. As the cell repolarizes, the sodium channels begin to recover, and the cell enters the relative refractory period, during which it requires a larger stimulus to depolarize. Eventually, the cell reaches the supranormal period, where it is more excitable than usual due to the complete recovery of the sodium channels.'],\n",

T-tubules extend the surface area of the cardiomyocyte and help transport intracellular calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores and releases calcium to activate myofilaments and cause contraction. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and expose actin binding sites, causing myosin heads to bind and pull actin filaments past each other.

There are two types of PVCs: those that arise from an ectopic focus in the atria and those that arise from an ectopic focus in the ventricles. PVCs can occur due to various factors such as stress, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, certain medications, and medical conditions. They can also result from surgery, trauma, or radiation therapy. PVCs can be classified based on their location and frequency. Some common locations include the His-Purkinje system, the coronary artery vasculature, and the conductive system of the ventricles. Frequent PVCs can lead to compensatory mechanisms that allow the heart to continue functioning normally. However, PVCs can also disrupt the normal cardiac rhythm and potentially lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmic death.\\n\\nThe ECG is useful in identifying PVCs by showing a distinct QRS complex. Lead V1 can help determine the site of the ectopic focus. Compensatory pauses occur when a normal sinus complex lands exactly two times the normal sinus interval, while noncompensatory pauses occur when the sinus complex lands less than two times the normal sinus interval. Premature ventricular contractions can occur at different stages of the cardiac cycle and can produce different ECG patterns. Bigeminy and trigeminy refer to specific patterns of premature ventricular contractions.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occur when ventricular pacemaker cells fire at the wrong time, but the surrounding cells have similar properties, causing the ventricles to contract.

Functional reentry occurs when the wave of conduction curves and spirals out of control due to differences in cell properties. Anatomical reentry happens when there is scar tissue present from a previous heart attack. External electrical stimulation can also induce VF.

They're divided into two categories: alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and methyldopa. Examples of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla, to decrease the release of norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, resulting in lower blood pressure. Meanwhile, alpha-2 receptor agonists, particularly clonidine, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the prefrontal cortex to moderate the amount of norepinephrine in this area of the brain, helping to tune out irrelevant stimuli and sharpen focus. However, the main side effect of these medications is that blood pressure may fall too low and cause orthostatic hypotension. If someone quits taking them too abruptly, blood pressure may climb over the roof and cause severe rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic activity. Other side effects include sedation, fatigue, nausea, and gastric upset. Methyldopa is another central anti-adrenergic medication that works differently than alpha-2 receptor agonists. It looks like L-DOPA, so it fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine. Methyldopamine can’t be broken down by monoamine oxidases, so it builds up and moves into the synaptic vesicles, where it gets converted to methylnorepinephrine.

When this happens, the excess blood volume creates a greater pressure on the heart with each beat, leading to an increase in afterload. Over time, this extra workload leads to thickening of the heart muscle, which becomes less efficient and contributes to the development of heart failure.In summary, the compliance of blood vessels determines the relationship between blood volume and pressure, and the elasticity of the vessels affects the recoil or snap back of the vessel walls after each beat of the heart.

It signifies the transition from filling to contraction.\\n* **First Heart Sound (S1)**: The first heart sound, or S1, occurs when the mitral valve closes, marking the end of diastole and the beginning of systole. It\\'s caused by the sudden cessation of blood flow into the ventricle, creating a \"lup\" sound.\\n* **Isovolumetric Contraction Phase**: During this phase, the left ventricle contracts, but since both mitral and aortic valves are closed, blood cannot enter or leave the ventricle, and the volume doesn\\'t change. This phase lasts for about 0.05 seconds.\\n* **Ejection Phase**: Also known as the systole, this phase begins when the aortic valve opens, allowing blood to flow into the aorta. The pressure inside the left ventricle becomes greater than the pressure in the aorta, causing the aortic valve to open. Blood is forced into the aorta, decreasing left ventricular volume.\\n* **Second Heart Sound (S2)**: The second heart sound, or S2, occurs when the aortic valve closes, ending the ejection phase. This sound is created by the sudden cessation of blood flow out of the ventricle.\\n* **Relaxation Phase**: During this phase, the left ventricle relaxes, and pressure within the ventricle falls. Since all valves are closed, the volume remains constant. This phase lasts for about 0.15 seconds.\\n* **Isovolumetric Relaxation Phase**: This is similar to the relaxation phase, but with the added detail that the pressure within the ventricle falls below left atrial pressure, causing the mitral valve to open and allow blood to flow into the ventric'],\n",

Aneurysms may be detected incidentally during routine medical examination or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Alternatively, aneurysms may cause symptoms such as sharp, persistent, localized or generalized pain, depending on the site and size of the aneurysm, or neurological deficits due to compression of surrounding structures. Ruptured aneurysms typically present with acute, severe headaches, often described as \"the worst headache of my life,\" accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and stiffness or rigidity of the neck or limbs. Other symptoms include loss of consciousness, seizures, and pupil dilation. In cases of aortic aneurysm rupture, patients may experience hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and a sensation of a lump in the throat.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\n\\nImaging techniques such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are used to confirm the presence of an aneurysm and determine its size and location. Ultrasonography is also used to detect aneurysms, particularly in the case of intracranial aneurysms. Other methods include transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and digital subtraction angiography.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nTreatment options depend on the size, location, and degree of expansion of the aneurysm, as well as the presence of symptoms. Small aneurysms with no symptoms may be monitored through regular imaging studies, while larger aneurysms or those that are at high risk of rupturing may require surgical intervention. Endovascular repair involves the use of a stent-graft to reinforce the damaged vessel wall and redirect blood flow away from the aneurysm. Open surgery involves removing the damaged section of the vessel and replacing it with a graft. Both procedures carry risks and benefits and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.'],\n",

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",

It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors. The final step in the cascade is the formation of fibrin, which strengthens the clot and helps to maintain its stability.'],\n",

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not produce any clinical symptoms.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity produced by the PAC can stimulate the sensory nerves that detect changes in heart rate, producing the sensation of palpitations. Palpitations can also be caused by other factors such as anxiety or panic disorder.'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to draw out the fluid.

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections.

It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors.

It is characterized by an underdeveloped left ventricle and a smallish aortic and mitral valve.\\n* Cause of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: The exact mechanism that causes HLHS isn\\'t known, but one popular theory is that there might be some other primary congenital heart defect that reduces the blood flow through the LV and outflow tract during fetal development, so that part of the heart does not grow and develop normally.\\n* Effects of hypoplastic left heart syndrome on the heart: Infants with HLHS have a severely underdeveloped left ventricle and a small aortic and mitral valve. This results in poor blood circulation to the body, leading to cyanosis (bluish purple discoloration of the skin). Additionally, the aortic valve and mitral valve might be either too small to allow enough blood to flow through, or they might be absent altogether, which is called atresia.\\n* Prognosis for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Without intervention, HLHS is fatal. However, infants with HLHS can be treated with prostaglandin to keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing blood to flow to the body. Sometimes, a heart transplant may be necessary, but this is rare due to the complexity of the condition.\\n* Role of prostaglandin in treating hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Prostaglandin is often given to babies with'],\n",

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not produce any clinical symptoms.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity produced by the PAC can stimulate the sensory nerves that detect changes in heart rate, producing the sensation of palpitations. Palpitations can also be caused by other factors such as anxiety or panic disorder.'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to withdraw the fluid. Finally, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and any changes in symptoms is essential to ensure proper management of the condition.\"],\n",

The loop consists of four phases: ventricular filling, isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation. The PV loop helps explain how changes in various factors affect the heart's performance.\\n\\nAn increase in preload, which refers to the amount of blood in the left ventricle during diastole, results in a larger end-diastolic volume and a stronger contraction. This leads to a larger pressure-volume loop and increased stroke work. Conversely, if preload decreases, the opposite occurs.\\n\\nAfterload, which refers to the resistance offered by the blood vessels to blood flow, affects the pressure required for the left ventricle to eject blood. If afterload increases, the pressure required for ejection also increases, leading to a later opening of the aortic valve and a decrease in stroke volume. A decrease in afterload results in the opposite effect.\\n\\nContractility, which refers to the ability of the heart muscle to contract, affects the duration of the ejection phase. Higher contractility leads to a longer ejection phase and a greater stroke volume, resulting in a larger pressure-volume loop and increased stroke work. Lower contractility leads to a shorter ejection phase and a smaller stroke volume, resulting in a smaller pressure-volume loop and decreased stroke work.\\n\\nOverall, the PV loop provides valuable insight into how changes in these factors impact the heart's performance and can help diagnose cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure.\"],\n",

It is estimated that over 3 million people in the UK have COPD, making it one of the most common respiratory diseases worldwide. As the disease progresses, patients experience increasing breathlessness, cough and sputum production, leading to reduced quality of life and premature mortality. End-of-life care for patients with COPD is essential to ensure that their remaining days are comfortable and dignified. This article will discuss the key aspects of end-of-life care for patients with COPD.\\n\\n### Identifying when end-of-life care is needed\\n\\nThe identification of end-of-life care for patients with COPD requires recognition of several factors: advanced stage of the disease, comorbidities, poor health status, and declining functional capacity. Patients who are bedridden, unable to perform activities of daily living, or experiencing frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization are likely to require end-of-life care. Additionally, patients who express feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, or depression should be identified early so that appropriate support can be provided.\\n\\n### Communication and breaking bad news\\n\\nEffective communication is crucial in end-of-life care for patients with COPD. Healthcare professionals must communicate honestly and sensitively with patients about their condition, treatment options, and prognosis. Breaking bad news requires skill and empathy, and healthcare providers should provide emotional support to help patients process the information. Open communication helps patients make informed decisions regarding their care preferences, such as whether they want aggressive treatments or comfort measures only.\\n\\n### Advance Care Planning\\n\\nAdvance care planning involves a process of discussion and decision-making between patients, family members, and healthcare providers. The goal is to establish a plan that aligns with patient values, beliefs, and goals for end-of-life care. This includes identifying preferred place of death, type of medical interventions, and ethical considerations such as organ donation. Advanced care plans should be reviewed'],\n",

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",
              "  27: ['\\n### 10. What is the role of the coagulation cascade?\\nThe coagulation cascade plays a crucial role in stopping bleeding following injury to a blood vessel. It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors. The final step in the cascade is the formation of fibrin, which strengthens the clot and helps to maintain its stability.'],\n",

Secondary lung cancer is more common than primary lung cancer. It's important to note that both types of lung cancer can be deadly and require prompt medical attention.\\n    3. How do you treat non small cell lung cancer?\\n        * Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated using a variety of methods including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The choice of treatment will depend on factors such as the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and whether the cancer has spread beyond the lungs. Surgery is used to remove the cancer if possible, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells, while chemotherapy uses drugs to target and destroy cancer cells. Combination therapies, such as surgery followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy, are also commonly used. Clinical trials testing new treatments are always available for patients with NSCLC.\\n    4. Explain what a clinical trial is and why would someone participate in one?\\n        A clinical trial is a research study conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a potential new treatment or medical device. These studies involve people who volunteer to take part and receive specific interventions or medications that are being tested. Participants are carefully monitored and their health is evaluated throughout the trial. Clinical trials offer hope for many people who have exhausted all other options for treating their disease. They provide access to cutting-edge treatments before they become widely available and offer opportunities to receive state-of-the-art care at little or no cost. Additionally, participation in a clinical trial helps advance scientific knowledge about diseases and improves understanding of how best to treat them. Finally, participants receive close monitoring and attention from a team of healthcare professionals during the course of the trial.\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\nA[Angiosarcoma] --> B[Endothelial cells];\\nB --> C[Hemangiosarcoma/Lymphangiosarcoma];\\nC --> D[Cancer cells];\\nD --> E[Metastasis];\\n\"],\n",

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not affect the function of the heart.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity caused by the PAC can interfere with the normal filling of the heart chambers, leading to a sensation of fluttering or racing of the heart.\\n* What is the relationship between the site of the ectopic focus and the type of PAC produced?\\nThe site of the ectopic focus determines the type of premature atrial contraction (PAC) produced. Different locations of the ectopic focus correspond to specific types of PACs with characteristic ECG patterns. For example'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and stabilize blood pressure. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to withdraw the fluid. Finally, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and any changes in symptoms is essential to ensure proper management of the condition.\"],\n",

After birth, these structures should close, but if they remain open, it leads to a PDA.\\n### Takeaway 3: Prostaglandin E2 & Ductus Arteriosus Closure\\nProstaglandin E2 plays a crucial role in keeping the ductus arteriosus open during fetal development. It falls to near zero levels shortly after birth, leading to closure of the ductus arteriosus. However, if it remains open, it\\'s due to the presence of prostaglandin E2 produced locally by the ductus arteriosus itself.\\n### Takeaway 4: Shunting & Eisenmenger\\'s Syndrome\\nWhen a PDA persists, it creates a left-to-right shunt, allowing oxygenated blood to flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Over time, this can lead to increased pulmonary blood volume and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, potentially triggering Eisenmenger\\'s syndrome, where the direction of blood flow reverses, leading to cyanosis in the lower extremities.\\n### Takeaway 5: Treatment Options\\nIndomethacin and surgery are treatment options for PDA.

Specifically, the P wave represents the depolarization of the atria, which occurs simultaneously with the depolarization of the ventricles (the \"bundle branch block\"). The P wave therefore indicates the precise moment when the atria begin to contract and fill the ventricles with blood. Because the atria contract before the ventricles, the P wave appears before the QRS complex on the ECG, and its shape reflects the speed at which the depolarization wave travels through the atria compared to the ventricles. If the P wave is abnormal in some way, it may indicate a problem with the electrical conduction of the heart.'],\n",

How do we interpret the results?\\n    \\nAn ECG is a test that uses electrical signals to create a picture of the heart's activity. It shows how the electricity flowing through the heart changes over time. Electrodes are placed on various parts of the body to detect these electrical signals. These signals are then recorded and analyzed to provide information about the heart's function.\\n\\nElectrodes are typically placed on the chest (thorax) for a standard ECG. There are several leads that can be used for this purpose, including lead I, lead II, and lead III. Lead II is the most commonly used lead for a standard ECG. It consists of two electrodes: one placed on the right arm and the other on the left leg.\\n\\nTo interpret the results of an ECG, it is important to understand the different segments of the trace. The P-QRS-T segment represents the duration of the heart's contraction. The P-wave indicates atrial depolarization, while the QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization. The T-wave represents repolarization of the ventricles. The ST segment represents the period between the end of the T-wave and the beginning of the next cycle. Abnormalities in any part of the ECG trace may indicate a problem with the heart's electrical activity.\"],\n",

Aneurysms may be detected incidentally during routine medical examination or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Alternatively, aneurysms may cause symptoms such as sharp, persistent, localized or generalized throbbing or aching pain, depending on the site and size of the aneurysm, and the presence of any associated inflammatory or thrombotic processes. Ruptured aneurysms typically present with acute, severe, focal neurological deficits, accompanied by severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and possible loss of consciousness. Other systemic manifestations include hypertension, tachycardia, and hypotension.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\n\\nImaging techniques such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are used to confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm and determine its size and location. Contrast agents are injected into the patient's circulatory system to highlight the aneurysm and surrounding vessels on X-ray images. Ultrasound and echocardiography can also be used to visualize the aneurysm and assess its impact on cardiac function.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nTreatment options for aneurysms depend on the size, location, and degree of involvement of the affected organ or vessel. Surgery is the primary treatment option for most aneurysms, involving either open surgical repair or endovascular stent graft placement. Endovascular therapy involves inserting a stent-graft through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery, which is guided to the site of the aneurysm and deployed to reinforce the damaged vessel wall. Open surgical repair involves exposing the aneurysm and replacing the damaged segment of the vessel with a synthetic graft. Both procedures carry risks and benefits, and the choice of procedure depends on various factors such as the size and location of the aneurysm, the patient's overall health\"],\n",

The skin may appear reddish or blue due to the increased blood flow to the area. On examination, a physician will perform a physical exam to assess for signs of DVT, including edema (swelling), erythema (redness), warmth, and tenderness in the affected extremity. Additionally, a duplex Doppler ultrasound is used to confirm the diagnosis of DVT by visualizing the blood flow in the veins. Other diagnostic tests that may be ordered include a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for any evidence of bleeding or clotting abnormalities, and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans to look for any associated injuries or other causes of the patient's symptoms.It is essential to differentiate between deep vein thrombosis and other conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as cellulitis or a musculoskeletal injury.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of deep vein thrombosis involves a complex interplay of various mechanisms, including blood flow stasis, hypercoagulable states, and damage to the endothelium. Blood flow stasis can occur due to prolonged immobility or surgery, which can result in the formation of a thrombus. Hypercoagulable states can be caused by inherited or acquired risk factors, such as congenital or acquired deficiencies in anticoagulants, or exposure to environmental toxins. Finally, damage to the endothelium can expose subendothelial structures, such as collagen and tissue factor, which can initiate the coagulation cascade and promote thrombus formation.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is primarily based on clinical presentation and confirmed by imaging studies, such as duplex Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Immediate steps include establishing IV access, initiating fluid resuscitation, monitoring vital signs closely, and providing oxygen support. Additionally, drugs may be given depending on the type of shock. For instance, pressor agents like dopamine or noradrenaline may be given to patients experiencing hypovolemic shock while those with cardiogenic shock may benefit from diuretics to remove excess fluid from the circulatory system. In cases of distributive shock, fluids may be given to improve blood pressure and counteract the effects of vasodilation.

It allows oxygenated blood to flow from the umbilical vein to the right atrium, bypassing the non-functional lungs. After birth, the foramen ovale closes to reliably use the lungs for oxygenation.'],\n",

AVRT occurs due to an accessory pathway, usually the Bundle of Kent, connecting the atria and ventricles, allowing the electrical impulse to circulate repeatedly between the two chambers. AVNRT, on the other hand, occurs due to two separate electrical pathways within the atrioventricular node (AVN), one with slow electrical conduction (alpha pathway) and the other with fast conduction (beta pathway). When the impulse travels down the fast pathway, it meets the slower signal coming down the other pathway, leading to a brief moment of electrical activity in both paths simultaneously, resulting in a reentry loop.'],\n",

Just because someone has a certain type of heart rhythm on their ECG doesn't mean that's all they have. There are many types of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), and some of them can mimic each other. SVT is a group of fast heart rates that arise above the ventricles. They're usually caused by abnormal electrical signals in the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) nodes.

It has three leaflets that open and close during each beat of the heart. Tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backwards. Rheumatic heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and damage to the papillary muscles from a heart attack can all cause this condition. Congenital conditions such as Ebstein's anomaly may also contribute. Treatment typically focuses on managing fluid balance and addressing any underlying conditions. Tricuspid valve stenosis occurs when the valve does not open properly, making it difficult for blood to flow into the right ventricle.

Additionally, they may have a decreasing intensity of the murmur during expiration, which is known as a \"timing\" or \"midsystolic\" murmur. ECG findings may show signs of both hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction.

It typically happens after surgery or trauma, and requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nHypoproteinemia, a condition characterized by low levels of proteins in the blood, can lead to edema, which is excessive accumulation of fluid in the spaces between cells. This can result from malnutrition, kidney or liver disease, or other medical conditions.\\n\\nPhlebitis is inflammation of a vein, which can cause swelling, warmth, and tenderness in the affected area. It commonly occurs in the legs, particularly after prolonged periods of inactivity, such as sitting or standing still for long hours.\\n\\nThrombophlebitis is a more severe form of phlebitis that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein, leading to swelling, pain, and tenderness in the affected limb. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the lymphatic system is a vital network responsible for maintaining proper fluid balance, removing waste products, and supporting the immune system.

They consist of four main phases: 1) end-diastolic, 2) isovolumetric contraction, 3) ejection, and 4) isovolumetric relaxation. During each phase, specific events occur, such as the opening and closing of heart valves and changes in ventricular pressure and volume. These events lead to the calculation of important measurements, such as stroke volume, ejection fraction, and pulse pressure. Understanding PV loops helps medical professionals assess heart function and diagnose cardiovascular conditions.'],\n",

If the person uses their legs (preload) to push against the ground harder, they will be able to lift the object off the ground with less effort. This is similar to an increase in preload, as the left ventricle needs to contract less to pump blood out. On the other hand, if someone puts weights on the person's shoulders (afterload), it will require more effort to lift the object, as the weight adds resistance. Similarly, an increase in afterload, as the left ventricle must work harder to overcome the increased pressure in order to pump blood out. Lastly, imagine the person taking a drug that helps them contract their leg muscles more strongly (contractility). This will allow them to lift the object off the ground with greater ease, just like an increase in contractility allows the left ventricle to pump blood out more easily, resulting in a larger stroke volume and a larger pressure-volume loop.\"],\n",

Peripheral vascular disease happens when one of these arteries becomes narrowed, which reduces blood flow; this often affects the limbs.Peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, usually involves the arteries, so sometimes it’s also referred to as peripheral artery disease or PAD. PVD is usually caused by a blockage, called organic PVD, that is most commonly created by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a buildup of lipids and fibrous material just under the inner lining of the blood vessel, called the tunica intima. When plaque builds up, it narrows the artery, which reduces perfusion to whatever tissue it tends to supply; this buildup usually happens over the course of many years. However, the vessel could be blocked by an embolus, which can happen suddenly if a blood clot from some upstream artery lodges in a peripheral artery; this clot would obviously stop blood flow from getting to the tissue the vessel supplies.   Besides organic PVDs, there are also functional PVDs. With functional PVDs, blood vessels stop blood flow by changing diameter, such as with vasospasms, where the vessel constricts and blood flow is reduced. This type of PVD is usually short term, and can come and go.  The arteries supplying the legs are the most commonly affected vessels in peripheral vascular disease. When less blood gets to the muscle tissue in the legs, the tissue receives less oxygen and becomes ischemic. Ischemic cells release adenosine, a type of signaling molecule, which is thought to affect nerves in these areas; this is felt as pain. This pain in the legs is often referred to as claudication. Sometimes, even though blood flow is narrowed with PVD, when a person is at rest,'],\n",

Aneurysms may be detected incidentally during routine medical examination or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Alternatively, aneurysms may cause symptoms such as sharp, persistent, localized or generalized throbbing or aching pain, depending on the site and size of the aneurysm, and the presence of any associated inflammatory or thrombotic processes. Ruptured aneurysms typically present with acute, severe, focal neurological deficits, accompanied by severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and possible loss of consciousness. Other systemic manifestations include hypertension, tachycardia, and hypotension.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\n\\nImaging techniques such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are used to confirm the diagnosis of an aneurysm and determine its size and location. Contrast agents are injected into the patient's circulatory system to highlight the aneurysm and surrounding vessels on X-ray images. Ultrasound and echocardiography can also be used to visualize the aneurysm and assess its impact on cardiac function.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nTreatment options for aneurysms depend on the size, location, and degree of involvement of the affected organ or vessel. Surgery is the primary treatment option for most aneurysms, involving either open surgical repair or endovascular stent graft placement. Endovascular therapy involves inserting a stent-graft through a catheter inserted into the femoral artery, which is guided to the site of the aneurysm and deployed to reinforce the damaged vessel wall. Open surgical repair involves exposing the aneurysm and replacing the damaged segment of the vessel with a synthetic graft. Both procedures carry risks and benefits, and the choice of procedure depends on various factors such as the size and location of the aneurysm, the patient's overall health\"],\n",

The skin may appear reddish or blue due to the increased blood flow to the area. On examination, a physician will perform a physical exam to assess for signs of DVT, including edema (swelling), erythema (redness), warmth, and tenderness in the affected extremity. Additionally, a duplex Doppler ultrasound is used to confirm the diagnosis of DVT by visualizing the blood flow in the veins. Other diagnostic tests that may be ordered include a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for any evidence of bleeding or clotting abnormalities, and imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans to look for any associated injuries or other causes of the patient's symptoms.It is essential to differentiate between deep vein thrombosis and other conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as cellulitis or a musculoskeletal injury.\\n\\n### Pathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of deep vein thrombosis involves a complex interplay of various mechanisms, including blood flow stasis, hypercoagulable states, and damage to the endothelium. Blood flow stasis can occur due to prolonged immobility or surgery, which can result in the formation of a thrombus. Hypercoagulable states can be caused by inherited or acquired risk factors, such as congenital or acquired deficiencies in anticoagulants, or exposure to environmental toxins. Finally, damage to the endothelium can expose subendothelial structures, such as collagen and tissue factor, which can initiate the coagulation cascade and promote thrombus formation.\\n\\n### Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is primarily based on clinical presentation and confirmed by imaging studies, such as duplex Doppler ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The first step is to identify the underlying cause of shock and prioritize treatments accordingly. However, some basic principles remain constant regardless of the specific type of shock. Immediate steps include establishing IV access, initiating fluid resuscitation, monitoring vital signs closely, and providing oxygen support. Additionally, drugs may be given depending on the type of shock. For instance, pressor agents like dopamine or noradrenaline may be given to patients experiencing hypovolemic shock while those with cardiogenic shock may benefit from diuretics to remove excess fluid from the circulatory system. In cases of distributive shock, fluids may be given to improve blood pressure and counteract the effects of vasodilation. Finally, any underlying conditions leading to shock must be addressed promptly.'],\n",

From the pulmonary artery, it comes back to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and the whole process restarts. The \"great arteries,\" are the two main arteries taking blood away from the heart: the aorta and pulmonary artery. \"Transposing\" means that two things switch places with each other.

On the left side, blood is now pumped from the left ventricle, to the pulmonary artery, and to the lungs; it then comes back to the left atrium and left ventricle, and restarts the circuit. On the right side, blood is pumped out of the right ventricle through the aorta, and then goes to the body; blood comes back the the right atrium and right ventricle, and restarts the circuit. Blood on the right side therefore never gets oxygenated, and blood on the left side never gets deoxygenated. This isn\\'t good.

These abnormalities arise from a combination of factors including genetics, lifestyle, and medical history. Some people with Brugada Syndrome have a genetic predisposition linked to a mutation in the SCN5A gene, which codes for sodium ion channels in the heart's cell membranes. Others may have no identified genetic cause but still exhibit the characteristic ECG patterns. Risk factors include being male, having a family history of sudden cardiac death, and using certain medications such as diuretics, cocaine, and some antiarrhythmic drugs. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) to prevent fatal arrhythmias.\"],\n",

Just because someone has a certain type of heart rhythm on their ECG doesn't mean that's all they have. There are many types of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), and some of them can mimic each other. SVT is a group of fast heart rates that arise above the ventricles. They're usually caused by abnormal electrical signals in the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Some examples include:  \\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```diff\\nNormal Sinus Rhythm | Normal Sinus Rhythm with PACs | Atrial Tachycardia (AT) | Atrial Flutter (AFL) | Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) | Wandering Atrial Pacemaker (WAP) | Atrial Dyssynchrony (AD)\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1                       2                        3                         4                          5                          6\\n```\\nThe number represents how common each type of rhythm is relative to normal sinus rhythm. As you can see, only 1% of people have wandering atrial pacemakers, while atrial flutter is much rarer than atrial tachycardia. Normal sinus rhythm is the most common, followed closely by atrial tachycardia. Atrial flutter is actually pretty uncommon compared to the others.  \\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n```sql\\nECG Findings\\n--------------\\n\\n### Normal Sinus Rhythm\\n\\n| Feature               | Description                                                |\\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\\n| P-P Interval            | Time between P-waves                                      |\\n| QRS Complex            | Duration of the QRS complex                              |\\n| QT Interval            | Duration of the QT interval                             |\\n| PR Interval            | Duration of the PR interval                              |\\n| ST Segment            | Change in voltage following the T-wave                       |\\n| T-Wave                 | Amplitude and shape of the T-wave                         |\"],\n",

It can occur on the right (right bundle branch block) or left (left bundle branch block) sides of the heart. Right bundle branch block is characterized by a delayed contraction of the right ventricle while left bundle branch block results in a delayed contraction of the left ventricle. Electrocardiogram can help diagnose the type of bundle branch block by examining the characteristics of the P, QRS, and T waves. Lead II provides a good initial view of the heart's electrical activity, but chest leads such as V1 and V6 can provide additional information and are particularly useful for distinguishing between left and right bundle branch block.\"],\n",

Clinically, patients with mixed aortic valve disease present with a combination of symptoms from both aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. They may have a loud, distinctive mid-systolic murmur heard best at the base of the neck, which is caused by the increased blood flow through the diseased valve. Additionally, they may have a decreasing intensity of the murmur during expiration, which is known as a \"timing\" or \"midsystolic\" murmur. ECG findings may show signs of both hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction.

The Reynolds number, denoted by Re, is used to determine whether blood flow is laminar or turbulent, with low Reynolds numbers indicating laminar flow and high Reynolds numbers indicating turbulent flow. Factors such as the density and viscosity of the blood, as well as the velocity of blood flow and the diameter of the blood vessel, can be used to calculate the Reynolds number. Anemia, with its lower red blood cell count and hematocrit, results in a lower Reynolds number due to the reduced viscosity of the blood. Similarly, the presence of a thrombus or blood clot in a blood vessel will increase the Reynolds number due to the reduction in diameter of the vessel. Shear refers to the difference in velocity of the blood between the center and walls of a blood vessel, with higher shear occurring near the walls and lower shear in the middle of the vessel. Higher shear levels lead to lower viscosity of the blood, making it less sticky and easier for the blood to flow.'],\n",

As people age, healthy compliant arteries become stiffer and less compliant, leading to an increase in pulse pressure. Elasticity is related to the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. In the context of arteries, elasticity allows them to store energy during systole and release it during diastole, affecting blood pressure and pulse pressure.'],\n",
              "  7: [\"\\nThe main function of the heart is to circulate oxygenated blood to the body's tissues via the arteries and receive deoxygenated blood with waste products through the veins. This process happens in two stages: diastole (relaxation) and systole (contraction). During diastole, the left ventricle fills with blood up to 120ml, known as end-diastolic volume. At the end of systole, the left ventricle contracts to expel blood through the aorta, leaving behind an end-systolic volume of around 50ml. The difference between these volumes is called the stroke volume, which ranges from 70-120ml in healthy individuals. Another important measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume, typically ranging from 50-65%. These measurements help determine heart function and disease progression. Cardiac output is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate, providing the total volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle in a minute. Normal adults contain roughly 5L of blood, meaning every minute the entire volume passes through the left ventricle. Athletes can achieve high cardiac outputs of up to 35L/min. Blood flow is then distributed to different organs, with the liver receiving the most, followed by the kidneys. Kidney tissue perfusion is highest per gram of tissue compared to other organs.\"],\n",

It states that the amount of tension developed during systole depends on the number of myosin heads that bind to actin, which in turn depends on the length of the overlapping section between actin and myosin filaments. The longer the sarcomere, the more myosin heads will bind to actin and the stronger the contraction will be. Additionally, the more blood the ventricles hold during diastole, the more the sarcomeres will stretch, allowing more myosin heads to bind to actin and leading to a stronger contraction and increased stroke volume. However, if the ventricles become too full, the sarcomeres will become too long, causing fewer myosin heads to bind to actin and a weaker contraction.'],\n",

They show how these values change throughout each stage of the cycle, including diastole and systole. The loops help to understand the effects of changes in key factors such as preload, afterload, and contractility on the heart's performance. When preload increases, the end-diastolic volume expands, leading to increased stroke work. Conversely, when afterload increases, the end-systolic pressure rises, reducing the stroke volume and stabilizing the stroke work. Contractility influences the duration of the ejection phase, resulting in varying stroke volumes and thus stroke work.\"],\n",

Here\\'s a summary of the information provided:\\n\\nThe human body contains specialized cells called \"pacemaker\" cells located in specific areas of the heart that are responsible for generating the electrical impulses that regulate the heartbeat. These pacemaker cells work together with other types of heart cells (called \"cardiac muscle cells\") to create a functional syncytium that allows the heart to function properly.\\n\\nThe initiation of an action potential in a pacemaker cell is caused by depolarization, which occurs when certain ions (such as sodium) move across the cell membrane. This depolarization wave triggers a series of events within the pacemaker cell that ultimately lead to the release of an electrical impulse that travels to other parts of the heart.\\n\\nIn order to understand how depolarization works, it\\'s helpful to know about the role of ion channels in the movement of ions across cell membranes. Different types of ion channels respond to different stimuli (such as changes in the membrane potential), and their presence and behavior help to regulate the flow of ions and therefore the electrical activity of the cell.'],\n",
              "  12: ['\\nThe cardiac excitability refers to the ability of myocytes or myocardial cells to be depolarized or generate an action potential. This process is influenced by the presence of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, which determine whether or not the cell will depolarize based on their readiness. A more excitable cell will have more of these channels in the ready state, while a less excitable cell will have most of them inactivated. The process of depolarization involves a series of events including the entry of positive ions such as sodium and calcium through gap junctions, followed by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a surge of Na+ ions into the cell and resulting in depolarization. After the upstroke, the channels become inactivated, remaining closed and unavailable for another depolarization until they recover during the repolarization phase. There are three phases of the action potential: the upstroke, the plateau, the repolarization, and the refractory periods. The absolute refractory period occurs when all of the sodium channels are inactivated, preventing further depolarizations. The effective refractory period occurs when the cell has emerged from the absolute refractory period but is still not fully excitable. The relative refractory period follows, with some of the sodium channels having recovered and becoming available for another depolarization. The final stage is the supranormal period, where the cell is more excitable than usual due to the recovery of all sodium channels.'],\n",
              "  13: ['\\nThe text describes the mechanism of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, which is the relationship between electrical signals (action potentials) and mechanical changes (contraction) in cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes are connected by gap junctions and held together by desmosomes. They have T-tubules, which increase their surface area, and sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores intracellular calcium. When a cardiomyocyte depolarizes, calcium ions move from one cell to another via gap junctions and trigger further depolarizations. The presence of T-tubules helps bring calcium deeper into the cell, where it binds to ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and releases more calcium into the cell, leading to activation of myofilaments and cell contraction. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and expose actin binding sites, allowing myosin heads to bind and pull actin filaments past each other. The process uses ATP and eventually returns the calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria.'],\n",

It shows how the depolarization wave moves during each heartbeat, and can help diagnose abnormalities in heart function. Normal sinus rhythm is shown by a single heartbeat on an ECG, starting with the sinoatrial node and moving towards the apex of the heart. The depolarization wave moves faster through pacemaker cells than through the rest of the heart muscle cells. Ions can flow between cells during depolarization. The ECG measures changes in time (X-axis) and voltage (Y-axis), with zero being the isoelectric line.

Reading an ECG involves identifying the QRS transition, which occurs when the QRS complex changes from mostly negative to mostly positive in the chest leads. The QRS transition zone shifts based on factors like chest lead placement and heart anatomy. Alterations to the heart's overall QRS vector, such as those caused by scar tissue from a myocardial infarction or thickening of the muscle wall due to hypertrophy, can move the QRS transition zone. Right ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular infarction can rotate the QRS transition zone rightward, while left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular infarction can rotate it leftward.\"],\n",

It involves two types of baroreceptors: one located in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, and the other in the walls of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery/veins. High blood pressure triggers the former, while low blood volume triggers the latter. Both types fire neural impulses to the brainstem's cardiovascular centers, which then send signals to either constrict blood vessels and slow down the heart rate (lowering blood pressure), or relax blood vessels and speed up the heart rate (raising blood pressure).\"],\n",
              "  19: ['\\n        Peripheral and central chemoreceptors play important roles in regulating breathing and circulation. Peripheral chemoreceptors sense changes in the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood vessels and transmit signals to the brainstem to adjust the activity of the vasomotor and cardiovascular centers. The vasomotor center controls the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, limiting blood flow to peripheral organs and increasing venous return to the heart. Meanwhile, the cardiac accelerator center is inhibited, reducing the heart rate and contractility, while the cardiac decelerator center is activated, boosting the parasympathetic effects on the heart. Airway and breathing are regulated through the integration of inputs from both peripheral and central chemoreceptors. Central chemoreceptors monitor the levels of carbon dioxide and pH in the cerebrospinal fluid and trigger the respiratory centers to increase respiratory drive when necessary. They also respond to changes in blood flow to the brain, leading to the Cushing reaction, which increases blood pressure to maintain adequate perfusion of the brain.'],\n",

It occurs when one of the vessels supplying blood to the heart gets blocked, leading to death of heart muscle. There's two types of MI, NSTEMI and STEMI. NSTEMI doesn't show up on an ECG as well as STEMI does, and it's caused by partial infarct of the wall. STEMI has ST-segment elevation on ECG and involves the whole wall thickness. Signs and symptoms include severe and crushing chest pain or pressure, maybe radiation to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, nausea, fatigue, and dyspnea. Labs can confirm with high sensitivity troponin I, Troponin T, and CK-MB. Risk of arrhythmias is high immediately following an MI. Depending on how much contractile tissue is affected, patients might develop cardiogenic shock. Pericarditis and inflammation can occur in the days following an infarction. Healing process takes weeks to months and results in granulation tissue. Complications include heart failure. Fibrinolytic therapy, angioplasty, and PCI may be performed to restore blood flow. Reperfusion injury can occur due to returning blood flow, causing tissue damage.

These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla, to decrease the release of norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, resulting in lower blood pressure. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients benefit from these medications because alpha-2 receptor agonists, particularly clonidine, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors present in the prefrontal cortex to moderate the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain, tuning out irrelevant stimuli and sharpening focus. However, the most common side effects are orthostatic hypotension and rebound hypertension upon sudden discontinuation. Methyldopa is another central anti-adrenergic medication that works differently. It looks like L-DOPA and fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine, which can’t be broken down by monoamine oxidases. Built-up methyldopamine then circles back to act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neuron membrane, leading to further inhibition of norepinephrine release. Methyldopa is safe for pregnant women and can be used to lower blood pressure. Side effects include liver toxicity, allergic reactions, and hemolytic reactions.

The left ventricle plays a crucial role in this process, as it fills with blood during diastole and then contracts to eject blood during systole. These processes result in a stroke volume, which is the volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each beat. The stroke volume can vary depending on factors such as a person's size, and is typically around 70 milliliters. Another important measurement is the ejection fraction, which is the ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume. Normal values range from 50-65%, while low values could indicate heart disease. Cardiac output is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the number of heart beats per minute, and is typically around 4.9 liters per minute in healthy individuals.

This process is influenced by the presence of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, which can be either excitable or less excitable depending on their readiness. When enough positive ions (such as sodium and calcium) enter the cell through gap junctions, the voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing a large influx of sodium ions that leads to depolarization. After the upstroke of the action potential, the sodium channels close and become inactivated, making the cell refractory to further depolarizations for a period known as the absolute refractory period. As the cell repolarizes, the sodium channels begin to recover, and the cell enters the relative refractory period, during which it requires a larger stimulus to depolarize. Eventually, the cell reaches the supranormal period, where it is more excitable than usual due to the complete recovery of the sodium channels.'],\n",

T-tubules extend the surface area of the cardiomyocyte and help transport intracellular calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores and releases calcium to activate myofilaments and cause contraction. Calcium ions bind to troponin C and expose actin binding sites, causing myosin heads to bind and pull actin filaments past each other.

The position of the electrodes determines the perspective of the heart viewed. To interpret an ECG, it is important to understand the QRS transition, which occurs when the QRS complex changes from mostly negative to mostly positive in the perspective of the chest leads. The location of the QRS transition indicates the orientation of the QRS axis in the horizontal plane.

It's initiated by baroreceptors located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, which detect changes in blood pressure and fire neural impulses to the brainstem. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves transmit these impulses to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem, where they trigger changes in the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. The vasomotor center in the brainstem regulates blood vessel tone, with the cardiac accelerator and decelerator centers influencing heart rate and contractility. Low blood pressure triggers a cascade of events that decrease cardiac output, decrease total peripheral resistance, and allow blood to pool in the periphery, ultimately leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Conversely, high blood pressure triggers similar events that raise blood pressure. Additionally, there are cardiopulmonary baroreceptors located in the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery and veins that primarily regulate blood volume and are known as low-pressure or volume baroreceptors.

Hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis trigger the activation of the aortic and carotid bodies, which sends nerve impulses to the vasomotor center in the brainstem to constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure. Peripheral chemoreceptors detect low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels and send impulses to the brainstem to increase breathing and heart rate. Central chemoreceptors in the brainstem monitor the carbon dioxide level and pH in the cerebrospinal fluid and trigger an increase in respiratory drive. An increase in intracranial pressure can lead to brain ischemia and an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the cerebrospinal fluid, which will be detected by the central chemoreceptors and lead to an increase in blood pressure to maintain blood flow to the brain.'],\n",

The former is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and results in no permanent damage, while the latter is a true infarction and can cause permanent damage.\\n\\nIn the first few hours after an MI, the body tries to protect the heart by increasing its output and dilating blood vessels. However, if the infarction is large, the body cannot compensate and the heart may stop altogether. This is called a ventricular fibrillation (VF). If VF is not treated within minutes, it can lead to sudden cardiac death. Other potential complications include atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and arrhythmias.\\n\\nTo diagnose an MI, doctors use lab tests such as troponin I and T, and CK-MB, as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG). Treatment options include thrombolysis, angioplasty, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the heart. Reperfusion injury can occur if blood flow is restored too quickly, causing additional damage to heart tissue.

              "  45: ['\\n    An ectopic focus is a source of abnormal electrical activity within the ventricles that causes a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). There are two types of PVCs: those that arise from an ectopic focus in the atria and those that arise from an ectopic focus in the ventricles. PVCs can occur due to various factors such as stress, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, certain medications, and medical conditions. They can also result from surgery, trauma, or radiation therapy. PVCs can be classified based on their location and frequency. Some common locations include the His-Purkinje system, the coronary artery vasculature, and the conductive system of the ventricles. Frequent PVCs can lead to compensatory mechanisms that allow the heart to continue functioning normally. However, PVCs can also disrupt the normal cardiac rhythm and potentially lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmic death.\\n\\nThe ECG is useful in identifying PVCs by showing a distinct QRS complex. Lead V1 can help determine the site of the ectopic focus. Compensatory pauses occur when a normal sinus complex lands exactly two times the normal sinus interval, while noncompensatory pauses occur when the sinus complex lands less than two times the normal sinus interval. Premature ventricular contractions can occur at different stages of the cardiac cycle and can produce different ECG patterns. Bigeminy and trigeminy refer to specific patterns of premature ventricular contractions. While most PVCs do not require treatment, persistent symptoms may warrant treatment with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. Radiofrequency ablation can be performed if an ectopic focus triggers ventricular arrhythmias.'],\n",

This causes the heart to \"quiver\" instead of pump blood effectively, leading to a lack of oxygen for the body and brain, which can cause sudden cardiac death. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occur when ventricular pacemaker cells fire at the wrong time, but the surrounding cells have similar properties, causing the ventricles to contract. Three PVCs in a row is considered ventricular tachycardia (VT), which can progress to VF. Functional reentry occurs when the wave of conduction curves and spirals out of control due to differences in cell properties. Anatomical reentry happens when there is scar tissue present from a previous heart attack. External electrical stimulation can also induce VF. Once VF begins, the only reliable way to stop it is through defibrillation, either through external electrical stimulation or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

There are several different types of heart block, including atrioventricular (AV) block, which can either be first, second, or third degree. First degree AV block results in a slightly delayed signal, while second degree AV block sees the signal becoming increasingly delayed until it is eventually blocked altogether. Third degree, or complete heart block, occurs when the signal is completely blocked all the time.

They're divided into two categories: alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and methyldopa. Examples of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists include clonidine, guanabenz, and guanfacine. These medications stimulate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the CNS, especially those in the medulla, to decrease the release of norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, resulting in lower blood pressure. Meanwhile, alpha-2 receptor agonists, particularly clonidine, act on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the prefrontal cortex to moderate the amount of norepinephrine in this area of the brain, helping to tune out irrelevant stimuli and sharpen focus. However, the main side effect of these medications is that blood pressure may fall too low and cause orthostatic hypotension. If someone quits taking them too abruptly, blood pressure may climb over the roof and cause severe rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic activity. Other side effects include sedation, fatigue, nausea, and gastric upset. Methyldopa is another central anti-adrenergic medication that works differently than alpha-2 receptor agonists. It looks like L-DOPA, so it fools the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase to convert it to methyldopamine. Methyldopamine can’t be broken down by monoamine oxidases, so it builds up and moves into the synaptic vesicles, where it gets converted to methylnorepinephrine. Methylnorepinephrine then builds up inside the vesicles and pushes the true norepinephrine into the cytoplasm, where it gets chopped up by monoamine oxidases. When a signal comes, methylnorepinephrine is released instead. Since methyldopa can’t activate adrenergic\"],\n",

When this happens, the excess blood volume creates a greater pressure on the heart with each beat, leading to an increase in afterload. Over time, this extra workload leads to thickening of the heart muscle, which becomes less efficient and contributes to the development of heart failure.In summary, the compliance of blood vessels determines the relationship between blood volume and pressure, and the elasticity of the vessels affects the recoil or snap back of the vessel walls after each beat of the heart.

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",
              "  27: ['\\n### 10. What is the role of the coagulation cascade?\\nThe coagulation cascade plays a crucial role in stopping bleeding following injury to a blood vessel. It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors. The final step in the cascade is the formation of fibrin, which strengthens the clot and helps to maintain its stability.'],\n",

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not produce any clinical symptoms.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity produced by the PAC can stimulate the sensory nerves that detect changes in heart rate, producing the sensation of palpitations. Palpitations can also be caused by other factors such as anxiety or panic disorder.'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to draw out the fluid.

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",

It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors.

It is characterized by an underdeveloped left ventricle and a smallish aortic and mitral valve.\\n* Cause of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: The exact mechanism that causes HLHS isn\\'t known, but one popular theory is that there might be some other primary congenital heart defect that reduces the blood flow through the LV and outflow tract during fetal development, so that part of the heart does not grow and develop normally.\\n* Effects of hypoplastic left heart syndrome on the heart: Infants with HLHS have a severely underdeveloped left ventricle and a small aortic and mitral valve. This results in poor blood circulation to the body, leading to cyanosis (bluish purple discoloration of the skin). Additionally, the aortic valve and mitral valve might be either too small to allow enough blood to flow through, or they might be absent altogether, which is called atresia.\\n* Prognosis for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Without intervention, HLHS is fatal.

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not produce any clinical symptoms.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity produced by the PAC can stimulate the sensory nerves that detect changes in heart rate, producing the sensation of palpitations. Palpitations can also be caused by other factors such as anxiety or panic disorder.'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and support circulation. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to withdraw the fluid. Finally, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and any changes in symptoms is essential to ensure proper management of the condition.\"],\n",

The loop consists of four phases: ventricular filling, isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation. The PV loop helps explain how changes in various factors affect the heart's performance.\\n\\nAn increase in preload, which refers to the amount of blood in the left ventricle during diastole, results in a larger end-diastolic volume and a stronger contraction. This leads to a larger pressure-volume loop and increased stroke work. Conversely, if preload decreases, the opposite occurs.\\n\\nAfterload, which refers to the resistance offered by the blood vessels to blood flow, affects the pressure required for the left ventricle to eject blood. If afterload increases, the pressure required for ejection also increases, leading to a later opening of the aortic valve and a decrease in stroke volume. A decrease in afterload results in the opposite effect.\\n\\nContractility, which refers to the ability of the heart muscle to contract, affects the duration of the ejection phase. Higher contractility leads to a longer ejection phase and a greater stroke volume, resulting in a larger pressure-volume loop and increased stroke work. Lower contractility leads to a shorter ejection phase and a smaller stroke volume, resulting in a smaller pressure-volume loop and decreased stroke work.\\n\\nOverall, the PV loop provides valuable insight into how changes in these factors impact the heart's performance and can help diagnose cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure.\"],\n",

It is estimated that over 3 million people in the UK have COPD, making it one of the most common respiratory diseases worldwide. As the disease progresses, patients experience increasing breathlessness, cough and sputum production, leading to reduced quality of life and premature mortality. End-of-life care for patients with COPD is essential to ensure that their remaining days are comfortable and dignified. This article will discuss the key aspects of end-of-life care for patients with COPD.\\n\\n### Identifying when end-of-life care is needed\\n\\nThe identification of end-of-life care for patients with COPD requires recognition of several factors: advanced stage of the disease, comorbidities, poor health status, and declining functional capacity. Patients who are bedridden, unable to perform activities of daily living, or experiencing frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization are likely to require end-of-life care. Additionally, patients who express feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, or depression should be identified early so that appropriate support can be provided.\\n\\n### Communication and breaking bad news\\n\\nEffective communication is crucial in end-of-life care for patients with COPD. Healthcare professionals must communicate honestly and sensitively with patients about their condition, treatment options, and prognosis. Breaking bad news requires skill and empathy, and healthcare providers should provide emotional support to help patients process the information. Open communication helps patients make informed decisions regarding their care preferences, such as whether they want aggressive treatments or comfort measures only.\\n\\n### Advance Care Planning\\n\\nAdvance care planning involves a process of discussion and decision-making between patients, family members, and healthcare providers. The goal is to establish a plan that aligns with patient values, beliefs, and goals for end-of-life care. This includes identifying preferred place of death, type of medical interventions, and ethical considerations such as organ donation. Advanced care plans should be reviewed'],\n",

With Kawasaki disease, the immune system attacks the arteries, leading to damage to the endothelial cells in the blood vessels and exposure of the underlying collagen and tissue factor in the middle layer of the blood vessel (tunica media). This leads to blood coagulation, aneurysm formation, and potential heart complications such as myocardial infarction.\\n\\nWho does Kawasaki disease primarily affect?\\n\\nAnswer: Kawasaki disease primarily affects infants and young children under the age of five, with a higher incidence in boys.\\n\\nWhat is the course of Kawasaki disease?\\n\\nAnswer: Kawasaki disease is a self-limiting illness, meaning that the inflammation resolves on its own within six to eight weeks. However, if left untreated, there is a significant risk of developing heart complications, including myocardial infarction. Classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease include conjunctivitis with limbus sparing, a strawberry tongue, adenopathy, a rash that extends across multiple parts of the body, and high fever. Lab tests can provide clues to the diagnosis, including elevations in white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as microscopic urinalysis showing mononuclear white blood cells without evidence of bacteria. An echocardiogram can confirm the presence of vasculitis in the coronary arteries. Diagnosis requires four of the five CRASH symptoms plus a fever lasting five or more days.

Can prophylactic antibiotics prevent infections? The answer is yes, sometimes.Prophylaxis means giving an antibiotic before an infection occurs to prevent it. The decision to use prophylaxis should always be based on the likelihood of infection and the severity of the potential infection. Prophylaxis may be recommended for patients who have a high risk of developing an infection after surgery or other procedures.For example, before dental work, patients are often prescribed an antibiotic such as amoxicillin to take an hour before the appointment. This helps reduce the chance of developing an infection from bacteria present in the mouth. Similarly, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections with organisms commonly found in the gut.In addition, certain medical conditions require prophylactic antibiotics. Patients with sickle cell disease or splenectomy are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), and therefore may benefit from routine penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, travelers to certain regions with high rates of infectious diseases may be prescribed prophylactic antimalarials or other drugs depending on destination and individual risk factors.It's worth mentioning that overuse of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance, making these drugs less effective against bacterial infections. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, and they should be used judiciously.\"],\n",
              "  27: ['\\n### 10. What is the role of the coagulation cascade?\\nThe coagulation cascade plays a crucial role in stopping bleeding following injury to a blood vessel. It involves a series of complex chemical reactions that result in the formation of a stable blood clot to stop the bleeding. The cascade is initiated by the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IINa), which then activates several other clotting factors that work together to create a net-like structure of crosslinked fibrin. This process is tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate amount of clotting occurs to stop the bleeding without causing excessive clotting that could lead to complications such as thrombosis or emboli. The cascade is initiated by the release of tissue factor (TF) from injured cells, which forms a complex with factor VII (VII) and calcium ions. This complex activates factor IX (IXa) and factor X (Xa), which in turn activate the remainder of the clotting factors. The final step in the cascade is the formation of fibrin, which strengthens the clot and helps to maintain its stability.'],\n",

How do you treat non small cell lung cancer?\\n        * Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is treated using a variety of methods including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The choice of treatment will depend on factors such as the stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and whether the cancer has spread beyond the lungs. Surgery is used to remove the cancer if possible, followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells, while chemotherapy uses drugs to target and destroy cancer cells. Combination therapies, such as surgery followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy, are also commonly used. Clinical trials testing new treatments are always available for patients with NSCLC.\\n    4. Explain what a clinical trial is and why would someone participate in one?\\n        A clinical trial is a research study conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a potential new treatment or medical device. These studies involve people who volunteer to take part and receive specific interventions or medications that are being tested. Participants are carefully monitored and their health is evaluated throughout the trial. Clinical trials offer hope for many people who have exhausted all other options for treating their disease.

How is TGA treated?\\n\\nComplete TGA is a condition where both great arteries are transposed, while transposition of the great arteries refers specifically to the situation where the aorta is in front of the pulmonary artery. Complete TGA is more severe than transposition of the great arteries because it results in blood never being oxygenated in the right side of the heart and never deoxygenated in the left side of the heart. Complications of TGA include cyanosis, heart failure, and the need for surgical intervention. Treatment options may include medication or surgery, depending on the severity of the condition.'],\n",

The drug is administered intravenously, typically via a central line placed in the umbilical vein before surgery. The infusion is started at a low dose and gradually increased over several hours to achieve the desired effect. The typical duration of therapy is 48–72 hours, although it may be shorter if the infant undergoes surgery earlier. During therapy, the infant's vital signs are closely monitored, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory effort, and temperature.

How does it relate to premature atrial contractions (PAC)?\\nAn ectopic focus is a small area of abnormal electrical activity within the heart that can generate impulses that compete with the normal electrical activity of the heart. An ectopic focus can create a premature atrial contraction (PAC) by depolarizing the surrounding myocardium before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The PAC can disrupt the normal electrical conduction of the heart, leading to a variety of different ECG patterns depending on the location of the ectopic focus and the degree of dispersion of the electrical activity.\\n* Describe what happens during a premature atrial contraction (PAC).\\nA premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when an ectopic focus generates an impulse that reaches the atria before the normal electrical activity of the heart has completed. The impulse generated by the ectopic focus depolarizes the surrounding myocardium, causing the muscle fibers to contract and squeeze blood out of the atria. The resulting PAC is usually very brief and may not be noticed by the patient.\\n* Explain why some PACs produce no discernible effects.\\nSome PACs produce no discernible effects because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is already contracting. These PACs do not significantly alter the overall electrical activity of the heart and do not affect the function of the heart.\\n* Why do some PACs produce palpitations?\\nSome PACs produce palpitations because they occur during a portion of the cardiac cycle when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The abnormal electrical activity caused by the PAC can interfere with the normal filling of the heart chambers, leading to a sensation of fluttering or racing of the heart.\\n* What is the relationship between the site of the ectopic focus and the type of PAC produced?\\nThe site of the ectopic focus determines the type of premature atrial contraction (PAC) produced. Different locations of the ectopic focus correspond to specific types of PACs with characteristic ECG patterns. For example'],\n",

Perforation of the viscus may occur if a penetrating injury occurs, such as a stabbing or gunshot wound. Additionally, if the pericardium becomes thickened or fibrotic, it may constrict the heart, making it difficult for it to beat effectively. Consequently, patients with known pericardial conditions should undergo regular monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence or progression.\\n\\n### **How do healthcare professionals diagnose pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nDiagnosing pericardial tamponade can be challenging since the condition's symptoms overlap with those of other medical conditions. Healthcare providers use several methods to confirm the diagnosis, including physical examination, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. Physical examination involves listening to the patient's heart and lungs using a stethoscope. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography, CT scans, and MRI scans help visualize the heart and surrounding structures. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood chemistry tests, aid in identifying any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to pericardial tamponade.\\n\\n### **What are treatment options for pericardial tamponade?**\\n\\nPericardial tamponade requires prompt medical attention, and the primary goal of treatment is to remove the source of the fluid build-up. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause of the condition. In cases where a foreign object is present, removal of the object is crucial. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damaged or perforated organ. Medications may be prescribed to manage pain and reduce inflammation. Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain hydration and stabilize blood pressure. In severe cases, a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be performed to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. This involves inserting a needle into the pericardium to withdraw the fluid. Finally, close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and any changes in symptoms is essential to ensure proper management of the condition.\"],\n",
